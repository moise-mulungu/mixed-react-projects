# Team Name: 

# Goals (revisit weekly)
* Duncan: have the experience in the following roles: tech lead, project manager, employer; be ready to interview for a tech lead position; (Duncan will be leaning heavily on his mentors who have experience in project mgmt, tech lead, unit testing, freelance)
* Moise: have experience working on an agile team (git, jira, etc: very important), full-stack portfolio site, full-stack real-world app, full-stack training (todo: elaborate); be ready to interview for Junior Dev position AND be ready to work as a Junior Dev on freelance projects
* Team: freelance-ready starter repo and work process - let's get come clients and make some money.

# git
* branches: main, development, duncan, moise
  * task-based branches based on Jira ticket names: bug/photon-1234, feat/photon-1234

# Mission Statement
* excellent product
* work-life balance
* always be cool as a cucumber ðŸ˜Ž (grace under pressure)

# Work Product
* todo: describe briefly the real-world things to produce
* portfolio site
* real-world app (Moise) (DM note: I've asked 2 mentors, they say 1 complex app is enough, absolutely necessary, but 1 is enough)
* starter repo for freelance work - represents the best from all repos we work on

# Work Process: Agile
* everything is ITERATIVE, including the processes this doc describes
  * schedule, goals, will change, 
* using Duncan's work experience as a model, tweaking as we go along,
  * Duncan will revise often (rapid change causes stress, but one of Duncan's goals is to refine a management style quickly)
* 1-week sprints
  * Mon-Thu - tasks (coding, research ("spike"), )
  * Fri - bug fixes, cleanup, documentation, organizing (ex: refining this file)
    * Fri afternoon: networking (email, chat, video with tech friends); career development (interview practice: pramp, codewars); toolbox (ex: VS Code skills)
* time to complete tasks are estimated as "story points": 1 point == one day work (allow for);
* daily schedule
  * !! consistency is important: always meet, even if the work is behind schedule; plan ahead: if we can't make a standup, reschedule ahead of time.
  * standups (max 5/week) 
    * What time of day??? Duncan's AM, PM, discuss.
      * Duncan will open the meeting up 15 minutes before the start time; Moise will connect 15 min ahead to allow for issues like rain (unpredictable internet)
    * Moise brings up any blockers, questions, reports what was completed yesterday, discuss plan for today.
    * !!! Duncan, Moise both git-commit before the other wakes up in the morning :)
  * Moise 1 hour/day working on specific technical skills
    * (Duncan, Moise TODO) list the skills: CSS, JS, back-end (RDB, REST, GraphQL)
* every 6 weeks, retrospective, cooldown
  * 
  * (Moise chooses a task/skill of his interest, but that is related to the project)
* WU transfer: first business day of each month (??? is this OK? can do more often, WU makes the submission process easy, but since it requires a trip downtown)

# Communication Tools
## practices
* ??? aka "fishhooks" means there is a question, concern, "hey look at this"
* word? - the "?" signifies doubt
* !!! means "important" depending on the number of "!"
* comments in code: // DM: duncan's comment goes here
* knowledge base (KB): this repo will serve as a 
## GitLab (or Github)
## Jira
* todo: Duncan will set up Pro account, describe the process, Moise will implement it in Jira (Jira is highly configurable)
## Shared Docs
* Google Doc team account
## VS Code (.md files in the repo)
## Slack (when our work time overlaps)

# Developer Toolbox
* VS Code
  * Extensions: spell check
* Chrome
  * Extensions: Grammarly: test grammar of your comments by copy/paste into an email
* Gmail

# Technology
* JS
  * React
* TailwindCSS
* database
  * mySql (DaaS? database as a service)
  * MongoDB (for prototyping)
  * Prisma ORM (object-relational model)
  * Arquero

# Project Management (medium- and long-term schedule, progress tracking)

# Project Standards (DM todo)
* !!!!! consistency - makes the workday go smoothly and reduces cognitive load
* avoid capital letters? (todo DM: think more on it)
## code standards: ex: ideal directory structure; file-naming (lowercase, snake-case), variable-naming standards (pascalCase unless React Component or constant); 
  * !!! spelling, grammar - reduce distractions. Software Engineer minds are pattern-matching machines that are vigilant for defects: 
## VS Code setup (to most easily share a repo): eslint, prettier, extensions (ex: spell check)
  * Duncan and Moise 

# Moise
* specific plan, goals, desc finished product
* retrospective - part of 2-week sprints
  * self-assessment both


# Sunday
* go over this doc
* write 
* demo Jira

# Week One starting Wed Feb 1
* git lessons, jira, 



# Moise tasks
* Agile videos - methodology DEVs use to take work from development to production; breaking down work into individual tasks; ensures quality - avoids unexpected problems at the end of a project.
  * steps: development, code review/UI sanity check (blast radius), test (individual tasks), 
  * DM todo: vocabulary list,
  * etc: pair programming, code review, frequent testing, "adaptable" (make sure everything running), "saving" (once task done correctly, avoid re-do), individual carries his weight (don't slow down everyone else)
* site hierarchy - bullet points
  * DM todo: move to repo
* semantic html: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics
  * read up, try to use those names when writing and talking about the site structure
  * Duncan todo: ensure proper use in the portfolio project
* review JS for React ohq page: https://observablehq.com/d/26916509ce268668
* done: send Duncan hierarchy doc link (or put in the repo)
* ttd: add above: ongoing: src/utils - start recording what you learn as functions
* Moise next tasks
* Duncan next tasks
  * upload Agile notes on google Doc
  * google Group/Team for shared Google Docs
  * take Moise Agile notes and adapt to a document of OUR process

Feb 1: 

# Duncan
* naming of parts of a page - list 
  * top/right/left nav, content, footer
  * content
    * todo: semantic html items; see tailwindui for naming
* apply Moise's hierarchy to skeleton React in portfolio repo
