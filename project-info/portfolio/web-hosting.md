# Vercel: deployment and hosting

# moisemulungu.vercel.app initially, later can buy custom domain if needed

- "moisemulungu" will be the "project name" in Vercel

# todo when it's time to publish: GitLab to Vercel

# DM: todoMM: practice deploying to Vercel (using GitHub, but it will be very similar via GitLab)

- get a practice repo
  - git clone https://github.com/vercel/next.js (It's a big file!!)
  - cd to examples/api-routes (done)
  - create a new repo on your GitHub (that's the new GitHub repo: vercel-api-routes)
  - initialize git and do the necessary in order to push this new repo to GitHub (done)
- Google: "GitHub to vercel"
  - connect your GitHub repo to Vercel and publish the repo on Vercel(successfully deployed, but I got page not found)
    howtonextjs: Once connected to your vercel account, go to the link `Deploying a Git repository` and select a GitHub
- !!!important: fill in the bullet points above all of the steps you take (i.e., document the process). Also, I want to see some howtonextjs lines among your documented steps (just do howtonextjs for stuff that is new to you, or tricky, or non-intuitive - issues you may ask yourself about later).
- then, learn about nextjs API routes by looking at the code in the repo, keeping in mind the info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes
  (cool!)
