# Vercel: deployment and hosting

# moisemulungo.vercel.app initially, later can buy custom domain if needed
* "moisemulungu" will be the "project name" in Vercel
  * https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains/working-with-domains

# todo when it's time to publish: GitLab to Vercel
https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/git/vercel-for-gitlab

# DM: todoMM: practice deploying to Vercel (using GitHub, but it will be very similar via GitLab)
* get a practice repo
  * git clone https://github.com/vercel/next.js
  * cd to examples/api-routes
  * create a new repo on your GitHub
  * initialize git and do the necessary in order to push this new repo to GitHub
* Google: "GitHub to vercel"
  * connect your GitHub repo to Vercel and publish the repo on Vercel
* !!!important: fill in the bullet points above all of the steps you take (i.e., document the process). Also, I want to see some howtonextjs lines among your documented steps (just do howtonextjs for stuff that is new to you, or tricky, or non-intuitive - issues you may ask yourself about later). 
* then, learn about nextjs API routes by looking at the code in the repo, keeping in mind the info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes
