# Gmail

- send "as if from gmail" no longer an option

# Postmark recommended by Vercel

- domain not necessary
- email address from work or private domain required
- https://postmarkapp.com/send-email/node - Postmark provides a GitHub package for sending email

# mailtrap.io

- looks like a great service
- must have custom domain

# conclusion
//(MM:yes, it gonna help) DM: bump:
- get a domain like moisemulungu.com - you'll need it anyway
- use Postmark (sign up using the email address moise|webmaster|info@moisemulungu.com)
  - think on what addresses you'll need:
    - I'd guess moise@moisemulungu.com for all correspondence. i believe you'll set up all your email to forward to your gmail account, so that you can get all your mail in one place: gmail.
    - info@moisemulungu.com can be shown on your website. Gmail spam filters are pretty good? because you'll get spammed at any address that you publish on the web.
    - Maybe use webmaster@moisemulungu.com for technical contact, like for the postmark service, (but use your gmail email address for namecheap/godaddy).(ok!)
