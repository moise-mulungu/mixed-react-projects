# Gmail
* send "as if from gmail" no longer an option

# Postmark recommended by Vercel
* domain not necessary
* email address from work or private domain required 
* https://postmarkapp.com/send-email/node - Postmark provides a GitHub package for sending email

# mailtrap.io 
* looks like a great service
* must have custom domain

# conclusion 
* get a domain like moisemulungu.com - you'll need it anyway
* use Postmark (sign up using the email address the-man@moisemulungu.com)
