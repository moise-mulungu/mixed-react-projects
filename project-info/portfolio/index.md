# next steps
- Duncan
  - review top-level jsx/html
  - look for repeated stuff to consolidate (abstract into reusable components)
  - anything to abstract into src/ui (lowest priority)
- Moise
  - look at the entire portfolio, fix little things, make a list of more involved things still to be done
  - contact form
    - implement production email API and test it with the testing url

# gameplan
* clean it up: unnecessary comments, better UI (colors, spacing)
* complete anything that's not done (ex: contact form)
* publish to Vercel
