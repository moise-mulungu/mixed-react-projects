## plug-in
plug-in also called add-on or extension is a computer software that adds new functions to a host program without altering the host program itself.
* DM: great, todoMM: move this to the new tech-vocabulary.md file
  * btw, if I indent a bullet point after a "DM:" this means that all the indented bullet points are part of the upper-level bullet point where I put "DM:"

## IDE(integrated development environment)

A software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.

# utility classes (a predefined design system)

1. flexbox: `flex`, `shrink-0`
2. padding: `p-6`
3. max-width: `max-w-sm`
4. margin: `mx-auto`
5. background color: `bg-white`
6. border-radius: `rounded-xl`
7. box-shadow: `shadow-lg`
8. width and height: `w-12` `h-12`
9. space-between: `space-x-4`
10. font-size: `text-xl`
11. text-color: `text-black`
12. font-weight: `font-medium`

* DM: todoMM: write a short paragraph on the benefits of using utility classes (hint: just look for why TailwindCSS chose them)
* Duncan's opinion: inline CSS (or TW utility classes) is better than separate .css files, because you don't have to look back and forth from .css file to .js file in order to see what each CSS class means - it's right there in the JSX. 

## responsive utility designs
Five breakpoints by default:
1. `sm`	640px	`@media (min-width: 640px) { ... }`
2. `md`	768px	`@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }`
3. `lg`	1024px	`@media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }`
4. `xl`	1280px	`@media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }`
5. `2xl`	1536px	`@media (min-width: 1536px) { ... }`
