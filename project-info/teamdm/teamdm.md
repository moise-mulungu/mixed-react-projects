# Team Name Ideas

- suggestions:
  - Duncan: The IG (the Ingenious Geniuses)
  - freelance company name:
    - Duncan: <something> WebTech

# Goals (revisit weekly)

- Duncan: have the experience in the following roles: tech lead, project manager, employer; be ready to interview for a tech lead position; (Duncan will be leaning heavily on his mentors who have experience in project mgmt, tech lead, unit testing, freelance)
- Moise: have experience working on an agile team (git, jira, etc: very important), full-stack portfolio site, full-stack real-world app, full-stack training (todo: elaborate); be ready to interview for Junior Dev position AND be ready to work as a Junior Dev on freelance projects
- Team: "freelance-ready starter repo" and work process - let's get come clients and make some money.

# git

- branches: main, development, duncan, moise
  - task-based branches based on Jira ticket names: bug/photon-1234, feat/photon-1234

for push

# Team Mission Statement

- excellent product
- work-life balance
- always be cool as a cucumber ðŸ˜Ž (grace under pressure)

# Work Product

- todo: describe briefly the real-world things to produce
- portfolio site
- real-world app (Moise) (DM note: I've asked 2 mentors, they say 1 complex app is enough, absolutely necessary, but 1 is enough).
- todo DM: training: what real-world things will Moise produce and where keep them
  - knowledge base, code snippets, etc.
- starter repo for freelance work (DM) - represents the best from all repos we work on
- this process

# Work Process: Agile

- everything is ITERATIVE, including the processes this doc describes
  - schedule, goals, will change,
- using Duncan's work experience as a model, tweaking as we go along,
  - Duncan will revise often (rapid change causes stress, but one of Duncan's **goals** is to refine a management style quickly)
- 2-week sprints (Moise: Jira.com suggested default is 2 weeks, let's try that)
  - Mon-Thu - tasks (coding, research ("spike"), training)
  - Fri - bug fixes, cleanup, documentation, organizing (ex: refining this file)
    - Fri afternoon: networking (email, chat, video with tech friends); career development (interview practice: pramp (1 per week, soft skills, dsa), codewars); toolbox (ex: VS Code skills - search "my favorite VS code tricks/extensions/shortcuts", then teach Duncan)
- JIra ticket for each task: bug, feature (story, gets story points)
- time to complete tasks are estimated as "story points": 1 point == one day work (allow for can't program 8hrs/day) (skill: how to extimate and manage the boss's expectations);
- daily schedule
  - !! consistency is important: always meet, even if the work is behind schedule; plan ahead: if we can't make a standup, reschedule ahead of time.
  - first: pull the repo, read all the diffs, answer questions,
  - ongoing: record progress in our Tasks section, marking tasks as "(done)" and detailing progress on tasks, asking questions.
  - daily standups
    - 6am/3pm - 8am/5pm: Slack
      - discuss everything that can be discussed well via text
      - we can try voice huddles later, maybe that will work in lieu of Zoom
    - 7AM MT (4PM Goma); duration: 10 to 30 minutes
      - Duncan will open the Zoom meeting up 15 minutes before the start time; Moise will connect 15 min ahead to allow for issues like rain (unpredictable internet)
    - Moise brings up any blockers, questions, training, reports what was completed yesterday, discuss plan for today.
    - !!! Duncan, Moise both git-commit before the other wakes up in the morning :)
  - Moise 1 hour/day working on specific technical skills
    - (Duncan, Moise TODO) list the skills: CSS, JS, back-end (RDB, REST, GraphQL)
- Sundays - planning, teaching, feedback for D and M
- every 6th week, retrospective, cooldown
  - cooldown: Moise chooses a task/skill of his interest, but that is related to the projects)
- WU transfer: first business day of each month (??? is this OK? can do more often, WU makes the submission process easy, but since it requires a trip downtown)
  - 2 weeks, then see

# communication: see ./communication-tools

# developer toolbox: see ./developer-toolbox

# project ideas: see ./project-ideas

# training: see ./training

# Technology

- JS
  - React
- TailwindCSS
  - answer
- database
  - mySql (DaaS? database as a service)
  - MongoDB (for prototyping) with Mongoose (ODM - object-document model)
  - Prisma ORM (object-relational model)
  - Arquero - JS data munging tool (excellent data-manipulation vocabulary in the docs and naming conventions)

# Project Management (medium- and long-term schedule, progress tracking)

# todoDM: Project Standards

- !!!!! consistency - makes the workday go smoothly and reduces cognitive load
- avoid capital letters? (todo DM: think more on it)

## code standards: ex: ideal directory structure; file-naming (lowercase, snake-case), variable-naming standards (pascalCase unless React Component or constant);

- !!! spelling, grammar - reduce distractions. Software Engineer minds are pattern-matching machines that are vigilant for defects:

## VS Code setup (to most easily share a repo): eslint, prettier, extensions (ex: spell check)

- Duncan and Moise

# Moise tasks

## daily routine

(done)

- first thing: pull Duncan's latest commits and look at the diffs (compare your last commit before my commit to the working tree in GitLens to see what changes I made)
- todoMMs: update repo with notes and "(done)" or "(partial)" when task is complete or you have worked on it
- work plan
  - focus on all the todoMM for up to 2 hours, then split remaining time as below (temporary until you're caught up on the todoMM)
    - if there are todoMM that you've already completed, mark them as (done) and I'll have a look
    - please follow up on all my todoMM ASAP, if they are quick tasks - if they are larger tasks, they can be done later. We'll start using Jira soon, but for now, if you can't finish a todoMM before the next 6:45am meeting, leave a note estimating how many hours you estimate you'll need to complete it (this is good practice, and hard - my boss always asks me to estimate ...ugh)
  - 33% hours on the portfolio
  - 33% Core JS - any assigned exercises then codeWars when you're done
    - put all solutions in the repo so we can discuss them
    - I increased this percentage to emphasize core JS. I will start assigning you more exercises.
  - 33% hours on Joy of React (put vocabulary and snippets in the repo)(start with components lessons, in progress)
    - gotta give JS and React significant priority - more knowledge will speed up your progress on the portfolio. BUt, yes it's also good to work the portfolio to have real-world React to work through.
  - all learning tasks: keep adding to the vocabulary files
- 3:45pm push repo to the remote
  - push what you have - just wrap up what you can, mark whatever is unfinished like this: "// MM: todoMM: unfinished, next steps: step1, step2, ..." Yesterday , I was thinking, that going forward I want to review what you have at 6:45am MT, so just plan on wrapping up and pushing at 6:45. You can keep working the rest of the day, and push that work the next day at 6. This will keep it simpler overall. So, you can save the work that generates a lot of questions for me for the 6:45-9MT time period, since I'll be around to answer.
- 3:45-5pm be on Slack (Duncan's 6:45-8am)

## next (unless there is a specific list for the day above)

- Hey, start thinking about a "cooldown" project. At work, previously at least, there used to be a 'cooldown' agile cycle each 6 weeks, where the team wraps up unfinished stuff that accumulates and each DEV gets to suggest a few 3-day projects that are of personal interest, but related to the goals of the team. THe manager picks one of the projects. So, start thinking about what you might like to focus on: a skill, an approach, a component. See what comes to mind over the next few weeks.
<!-- read -->
- when you complete a task, put "(done)" or "(partial)" - explain what's left to do)
- focus 1/2 on portfolio, 1/2 on Joy of React
  - start collecting snippets in the src/utils directory when you see new JS and React techniques
    - JS techniques
  - as you read, I'd like you to make a React vocabulary list in tech/react/vocabulary/index.md - this will be very helpful for both of us.
  - let me know which chapter you are reading, so I know what to discuss, teach you.
- set up GitHub notifications in Slack to a #GitHub channel
  - ???MM: Can you have tips on how to set up GitHub notifications on Slack.
    - DM: I'd like you to research it and see if it is possible. I assume slack-github are integrated so that a notification will come to Slack each time one of us pushes to the repository. We have this at work with gitlab-webex.
    - DM: In general, when I give your a random task, you may ask yourself, how long to try/research?: Google it for 5-10 minutes. if you are totally blocked, leave a note like "not possible", or "nothing on google indicates it is possible". If it IS possible, read some tutorials/instructions and give it a try. Don't spend more than like 30 minutes or an hour on it. If you get blocked, or you know it will take longer than an hour, stop, leave some notes on what you found out, what you did so far, with the links that are good, and we'll return to it. You could finish it later or we may decide it not to be worth the additional effort.
      - This is good practice for when the boss gives you random assignments. I would always expect you to research a bit, not ask me how to do it.
        - If you did research it and found nothing, or found limitations, you can tell me.
        - If I didn't describe the assignment clearly, ask for clarification. At my job, this is very important and happens a lot. If my boss gives me a vague assignment and I guess his intent wrongly, he'll get mad, and he'll tell me I should always ask for clarification before wasting my time possibly doing the wrong thing.
        - how much time to spend on it? You can assume that I think it is important, but that you should't lose too much time on it. One hour is good, 1/2 day is not (better to stop and report). Practice finding the right stopping point and report back your progress so far.
  - Moise, when I leave a big comment, just leave a note: "MM: read, thanks". I'll remove it later, or move it to another area.
- (done)find out what "liveServer" means when it is in the .vscode/settings.json

  - (liveServer.settings.port: Customize Port Number of your Live Server. If you want random port number, set it as 0.[Default value is 5500.]). I still do not know how did this land in the project, here is its source https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/docs/settings.html
  - ok, good job, I don't think it will hurt to leave it there. Leave a comment in the .vscode/settings.json saying that it wasn't added manually by us, and add your above summary to the comment also.

- (done) the change in package.json nextjs version from 'latest' to 12.1.6. DM: I think I may have told you to do this32
- (done) read about: nextjs 'next/head'

- read ./training.md
  - please understand everything here: https://www.vocabularyof.tech/vcs/git/new-git-repo
  <!-- ???MM: Is it required to start the git process from the($ echo "# repo-name" >> README.md), or someone can skip it?  --> It's required only if you're starting with an empty repo.
  - experiment with GitLens

## depends on DM

- (done for now) set up Jira (Duncan will create an account and provide the details)(will be delayed past Tuesday)
  - for now, focus on adding more columns the sprint board
  - DM: moise wrote: Created some sprints on Jira according to the basic portfolio tasks.

## done

- add your Agile notes to project-info/team-dm/agile/agile.md
- add Chrome and VS Code extensions (see ./developer-toolbox)

## ongoing

- Joy of React course (focus on this the majority of the workday)
- practice your vscode snippets and vscode shortcuts on Friday afternoons (if you have an coding challenge interview where the interviewers watch you type code, I want them to say, "Wow, this guy is fast!")
- src/utils - start recording what you learn as functions (to import and use) and snippets (to copy and paste)

# Duncan tasks (todoDM: these out of date, bad mentor!, clean up Sunday and start editing daily)

## daily routine

- 6:45-8am be on Slack
- pull Moise's latest commits
- answer questions made in the repo or texted in Slack
- updates to the repo
- 8am (or when finished) commit and push
- 5pm commit and push (if any additional changes)

## next (most tasks will be done on Sundays)

- ensure this app runs
- update docs with items discussed today
- look at Jira: "Meanwhile, you may check how I created sprints on Jira, fit seemed confusing at first. I need your assessment on that as well. Thanks"
- take Moise Agile notes and adapt to a document of OUR process (Moise will add his )
- (done) coding
  - npm i and make sure site runs
  - start with an HTML-only example, with list of similar HTML-only
  - put portfolio HTML into React, as a complete example (that uses CSS and scripts JS)
- GitLab account setup
- elaborate on training list: common git commands; code snippets

## depends on MM

## done:

## will be delayed

- send Moise Jira plan
  - look around
  - describe how it should work

## future, in order of priority

- coding standards (initial)
- coding standards (more detail)

## ongoing

- Joy of React course (read along, to discuss with MM, answer questions)
- UI vocabulary
- coding standards

## Sunday plan:

- pull (since MM sometimes has more commits by Sunday), respond, push
- review task lists
- communication process (email, slack, git diffs, zoom) 6:45 MT
- talk about our
- plan, train, etc.
- review Friday's code exercises
- specific topics
  - Jira - using Git diffs to communicate works well (?), however part of Duncan's learning ideally would be to pretend we are on a multi-person team, and that likely requires more thorough communication tools like Jira.
  - GitLab - again, Duncan's learning should include setting up CI/CD for the eventual production site
  - Internet outages
  - slack/git VS in-person - which is better for each situation:
    - learning NEW JS concepts, NEW procedures
    - practicing independent research-based learning (97% of all your learning as a DEV will be self-driven)
    - note:
      - slack/git implies independent research and building up a permanent knowledge-base in this repo
      - in-person teaching allows for more interaction
        - possibly: for any NEW process, work in-person to refine the process quickly, learn by example, etc. Afterwards, written communications may suffice. examples:
          - JoR examples to the /component-examples
    - DM: likely we need to think about which sorts of interactions are better in-person
  - DM: I notice I feel like spending the entire week focusing intensely on the portfolio, instead of splitting the time among the 3 ... but this is my feeling, it never happens that way at real work. However, when I get tickets, that is my full-time focus (but about 30% of the day is taken up by standups, reviewing others' code, testing other's work ...), but each day/few days/week, there is one main focus. Boss likes DEVs to do ONE ticket at a time, focus intensely and get it done.

I would like to emphasize on splitting any activity with Jira instead. For example for portfolio, and code-wars exercises

1. Portfolio: creating weekly, and monthly split tasks.
2. Code-wars: planning for weekly challenges, and monthly exercises by difficult levels
   DM: thanks, let me think and we'll discuss. What you describe seems more like project-management, like a visual timeline to view the plan over time. Does that sound like a correct interpretation of what you wrote? Maybe Jira has that capability, or maybe there is another tool.
   There is also the Internet outages that you mentioned above, any idea or suggestion?
