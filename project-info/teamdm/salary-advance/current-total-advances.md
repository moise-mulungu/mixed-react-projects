# current total advance balance

- from the Western Union money transfer of May, 19th 2023, you wired 500$ which makes my current advances total to 200$. - I would ask to start paying it by installment(50$) after i finish with school preparation of my daughters.
  - DM: OK, sounds good. You can do $25/paycheck if needed. $50 would be $100/month. Just let me know.

## advance policy
* lets set the max advance balance to the value of one paycheck: $300
* number of times it's OK to ask for an advance: 2 advances per quarter
