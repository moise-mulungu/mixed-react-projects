# Agile Methodology

- Agile in programming, is an iterative software development process that allows developers to build products by following a defined logic.
## Key features

- Planning
- Frequent testing
- Adaptable
- Savings
- Teamwork

1. Planning: is the first and the most crucial process of an agile methodology that is aimed to split tasks into the smallest one

2. Frequent testing: is the process that aims to add testing to the smallest task of the bigger task. This process prevent unexpected bugs in a large scale task.

3. Adaptable: is a process of adding any features while in the development process.

4. Teamwork: is a process on which developers share tasks and are accountable for a daily, weekly, and monthly target.

5. Savings: is the process of which every tested and approved tasks to be saved by avoid repeating once an unexpected loss of the task.

Note: The building process starts from the development and ends to the production.

# duncan's quotes he will merge into this document in later
"methodology DEVs use to take work from development to production; breaking down work into individual tasks; ensures quality - avoids unexpected problems at the end of a project."
  * steps: development, code review/UI sanity check (blast radius), test (individual tasks), 
  * todoDM: vocabulary list,
  * etc: pair programming, code review, frequent testing, "adaptable" (make sure everything running), "saving" (once task done correctly, avoid re-do), individual carries his weight (don't slow down everyone else)
