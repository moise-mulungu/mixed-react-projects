# pre-push

## gitlens diff showing all changes since last Duncan commit

## checklist

- all todoMMs marked with done, working, etc.
- default export function name matches filename, or directory name
- if file is in a directory, the main, or only, file is named index.js
- one exported function per file (I'll show you exceptions later(ok))
