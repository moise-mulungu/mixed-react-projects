consistency saves time and energy, helps avoid typo bugs
* in order to have consistency, you have to have rules (standards) to follow

* directory names - kebab-case
* Components - PascalCase
* functions - camelCase
* database (relational) column names - snake_case
* acronyms - strict camel case, acronyms not capitalized
  * myHtml, myUrl, myUi, myId - KISS, simpler is better(done)
