# every logical expression gets assigned to a variable
* why?
  * naming it makes it faster to read. motto: "more lines == faster reading"
  * fast, easy to console.log when you need to debug

# never use 'let'; if you do, explain why in a comment
* obviously, never use 'let' if you do not mutate the value; 'let' communicates that this variable will be mutated
* why (why this rule)? 
  * 
  * quick answer: when you write the code without 'let' it is usually more clear
  * todoDM: finish the 'why'
