# The justify-content
***The justify-content property in CSS is used with `FlexBox` and `Grid` layouts to align items along the horizontal axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. The different values for this property include:***

## flex-start
 Items are packed toward the start of the line.
## flex-end
 Items are packed toward the end of the line.
## center
 Items are centered along the line.
## space-between
 Items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line.
## space-around
 Items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them.
## space-evenly
 Items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
## start
 Items are packed toward the start of the line.
## end
 Items are packed toward the end of the line.
