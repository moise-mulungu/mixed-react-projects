## selector

A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
There are five groups of selectors in css(`attribute`, `class`, `id`, `pseudo-class` and `pseudo-elements`, `combinator`)

## rule

## property

Properties in CSS are the attributes you can specify values for, like `color` and `font-size`.

## value

CSS value definition syntax, a formal grammar, is used for defining the set of valid values for a CSS property or function.

## unit

## declaration

A declaration is a combination of a property and a value. THere can be as many declarations as possible in a rule; the first declaration is the first property and a value of a rule.
