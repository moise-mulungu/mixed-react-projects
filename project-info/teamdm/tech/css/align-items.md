# The align-items

DM: todoMM: good, put this in a folder called layout-modules to distinguish from the REST of CSS which is huge. same for the justify-content file

***The align-items property in CSS is used with `Flexbox` and `Grid` layouts to align items along the vertical (cross) axis. It sets the default alignment for all items within the container. Here are the possible values:***

## stretch
 This is the default value. If the element's specified height or width is auto, it will be stretched to fill the container (but not to overflow it).

## flex-start
 Items are placed at the start of the container. The cross-start margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-start line.

## flex-end
 Items are placed at the end of the container. The cross-end margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-end line.

## center
 Items are centered in the container.

## baseline
 Items are aligned such as their baselines align.

**Remember, align-items works on the flex container or the grid container, not on the items themselves.**
