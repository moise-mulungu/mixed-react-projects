# The Display property

***The display property in CSS specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. It is used to control the layout of elements, there are several CSS display properties, but the most commonly used ones are:***

## block 
 This makes the element behave like a block-level element (like a <div>). It starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

## inline
 This makes the element behave like an inline element (like a <span>). It does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

## inline-block
 This is a mix of both inline and block. The element is formatted as an inline element, but it can have a width and height.

## flex
 This turns the element into a flexible box, which provides a more efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among items in the container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

## grid
 This turns the element into a grid container, which allows you to define layout control within its grid. It is a two-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows.

## table
 This makes the element behave like a <table> element.

## none
 This turns off the display of the element; it takes up no space and is not visible.
