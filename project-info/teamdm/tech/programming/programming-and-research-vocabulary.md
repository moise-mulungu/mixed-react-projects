## guard clause 
A guard clause is a piece of conditional logic that is placed at the beginning of a function that will return out of the function early on if certain conditions are not met. Guard clauses are simple to implement in any function that involves conditional logic, and they make functions shorter and cleaner (readable)
<!-- Examples for more clarity, we'll be doing this in code-wars, grab an e later from there -->

## imperative and declarative
* imperative programming is a software development paradigm where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that *pre-coded models* are not called on.

* Declarative programming is a method to abstract away the *control flow* for logic required for software to perform an action, and instead involves stating what the task or desired outcome is. Declarative programming is a high-level programming concept, which is the opposite of imperative programming.
