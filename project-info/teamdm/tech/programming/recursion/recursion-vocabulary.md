## recursion

Recursion is a technique used to solve computer problems by creating a function that calls itself until your program achieves the desired result.


## What are the disadvantages of recursive?

Disadvantages of recursion are:

- Recursive functions are generally slower than non-recursive function.
- It may require a lot of memory space to hold intermediate results on the system stacks.
- Hard to analyze or understand the code.
- It is not more efficient in terms of space and time complexity
- If a sort of condition is not provided to stop the function, it's going to lead to an infinite loop.

## What are the advantages of recursive?

DM: might as well do the advantages, also, since recursive is used

## When to use recursion

DM: do this as well, good to have some guidelines

## base case

The **base case** is the condition to stop the recursion. The recursive case is the part where the function calls on itself.
