## A relative URL

Is a URL that only includes the path. The `path` is everything that comes after the `domain`, including the `directory` and `slug`. 
EX: /path/to/file.html

Because relative URLs don't include the entire URL structure, it is assumed that when linking a relative URL, it uses the same `protocol`, `subdomain` and domain as the page it's on.

## parameter
A parameter is a programming variable or value that transfers data between functions. Functions, which are self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks, receive input data (arguments) through parameters.

### url-parameter AKA query string parameter
A URL parameter is a component of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that follows a question mark "?" and is used to pass additional information to a web server. It consists of a key-value pair delimited by "&" or sometimes ";", where the key represents a variable name, and the value represents the data associated with that variable.

EX: https://www.example.com?name=John&age=30
