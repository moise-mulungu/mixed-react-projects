# anatomy of a URL

DM: discuss each part of the URL briefly here; (note: "slug" is a bit specific, so it may not appear in all anatomies of a URL)
DM: move the image file into this directory; make reference to it here;
DM: that image is good, but search again, and find an image that has more detail/more parts.
