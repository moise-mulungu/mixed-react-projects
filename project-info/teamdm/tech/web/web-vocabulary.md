## A relative URL

Is a URL that only includes the path. The `path` is everything that comes after the `domain`, including the `directory` and `slug`. 
EX: /path/to/file.html

Because relative URLs don't include the entire URL structure, it is assumed that when linking a relative URL, it uses the same `protocol`, `subdomain` and domain as the page it's on.
