<!-- open-weather-map src: https://openweathermap.org/ -->
* i used a VSCode extension Thunder client, an API platform for building and using APIs like postman: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client
* i learned how to use this extension by following the below steps:
  1. click on the extension icon on the VSCode left side bar
  2. click on "New Request" button
  3. paste the api call link that you copied from the open-weather-map site(not you api generated key) into the "Request" section and set it to "GET"
  4. once you paste the request into the "Request" section, parameters of the request will appear and, change the "appid" parameter to your generated key
  5. This process take a while approximately many hours to get activated. you need to be patient
