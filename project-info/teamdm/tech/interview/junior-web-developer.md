* i did only the behavioral interview.
* some common questions asked by AI for both Junior Software Developer and Junior Web Developer:
  1. Can you describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult team member?
  2. Tell me about a time when you made a mistake. How did you handle it?
  3. Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult client. How did you handle the situation?
  4. Can you describe a situation where you had to use your communication skills to get a point across?
  5. Tell me about a time when you had to handle a stressful situation at work. How did you cope with it? 
  6.  Could you illustrate a situation where your communication skills were crucial
  7. How do you create reports to communicate information to your teammates? 

DM: good info. I have written out answers to these types of questions, so I can review them before interviews. Not requiring you to do that, but I'll just say I've found it helpful. Live interview: it's hard sometimes to remember a good example on the spot. AI or chatbot interview: copy and paste.(ok)

* blockers: i could not proceed with the interview live coding as yesterday due to a bad connection.
