* how to do a google search for a general CS term: "computer science theTerm"
* wikipedia is very good search result to choose

# attribute
Attributes in object-oriented programming are defined for classes and objects such as a data element representing the quality or state of the class or object. An attribute defines a particular property of an object, element or file
* DM: todoMM: search google for the general CS meaning of 'attribute' like this: "computer science attribute"(done) 

## gotcha
In programming, a gotcha is a valid construct in a system, program or programming language that works as documented but is counter-intuitive and almost invites mistakes because it is both easy to invoke and unexpected or unreasonable in its outcome.(source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_(programming))
* DM: todoDM: add to Duncan's tech vocabulary list

## what is an opinionated formatter
an opinionated formatter enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.(i.e: Prettier, consistent formatting is wonderful).

## plug-in
plug-in also called add-on or extension is a computer software that adds new functions to a host program without altering the host program itself.
* DM: great, todoMM: move this to the new tech-vocabulary.md file(done)
  * btw, if I indent a bullet point after a "DM:" this means that all the indented bullet points are part of the upper-level bullet point where I put "DM:"

## IDE(integrated development environment)

A software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.

// DM: todoMM: make a new file programming-vocabulary.md and research, write new definitions: "guard clause" (google "programming guard clause"), imperative VS declarative programming - these will help understand some of what I'm saying in your code-wars exercises. ex: using 'let' and loops is imperative programming (explicitly write each step), using chained JS array methods is declarative. BTW, I'm enjoying your definitions research, and learning myself. This understanding and vocabulary will make you stand out, so keep up the good work!(thanks, done!)

## string interpolation
string interpolation in JavaScript is a process in which an expression is inserted or placed in the string. To insert or embed this expression into the string a "template literal" (previously called "template string")is used. By using string interpolation in JavaScript, values like variables and mathematical expressions and calculations can also be added.
