### Error: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.
* The React error `Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop` happens due to the state update in the main body of the component or invoking an event handler, instead of passing as a function

* ***howtojs: error: react:: cannot read properties of undefined; add an undefined check on the variable before you access a property on it***
### TypeError: cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'string')
* The `cannot read property of undefined` error happens when you try to access a property or method of a variable that is undefined.

* ***howtojs: error: react:: Objects are not valid as a React child ; map over the object by using Object.entries() to change it it into an array***
### Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {temp, feels_like, temp_min, temp_max, pressure, humidity}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
* The React. js error `Objects are not valid as a React child` occurs when we try to directly render an object or an array in our JSX code. To solve the error, use the ***map() method to render arrays or access properties*** on the object in your JSX code
