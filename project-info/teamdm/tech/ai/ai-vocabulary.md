DM; good!

## Prompt
A short sentence or phrase that is used to prompt a chatbot or other AI model to generate text or perform a task.

## Prompt engineering
The process of designing and optimizing prompts to achieve the desired outcome, such as improving the quality of generated text or optimizing the performance of an AI model.

## Fine-tuning
The process of training an AI model on a specific task or dataset by using additional data and fine-tuning the model's parameters.

## GPT-3 
A powerful AI model developed by OpenAI that is capable of generating text and completing tasks based on a large corpus of text data.

## GPT-3.5
A more advanced version of GPT-3 that is capable of generating more nuanced and human-like text.

## GPT-4 
The latest version of GPT-3, which is even more advanced than GPT-3.5 and is capable of generating even more complex and creative text.

## BERT 
A powerful AI model developed by Google that is capable of understanding the meaning of words and sentences and is particularly useful for natural language processing tasks.

## Transformer
A type of neural network architecture that is widely used in natural language processing and is particularly effective for tasks such as machine translation and text classification.

## NLP
Short for natural language processing, which is the study of how computers can understand and process human language.
Token: A unit of text in a natural language processing model, such as a word or a punctuation mark.

## Vocabulary
The set of unique tokens used in a specific dataset or language.

## AI chat
An AI chat, also known as a chatbot, is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence techniques to interact with users through textual or auditory means. It is designed to simulate human conversation and provide automated responses to user queries.
* EX asking AI to review or refine code by writing text in a chat window. EX GitHub Copilot provides a chat window in addition to suggesting code completions. 

## AI assisted coding
AI-assisted coding refers to using artificial intelligence to aid software developers in writing, reviewing, and, hopefully, improving their code. Large language models (LLMs) are at the heart of AI coding. 
* EX suggested code completions

## lookup table
A lookup table is a data structure used in programming to store a set of values, or mappings, which allows for a quick retrieval of a value associated with a particular key.

  ```js
  const vehicleLookupTable = {
    "2A": "Sedan",
    "2B": "SUV",
    "2C": "Truck",
    // more mappings...
  };
  const vehicleType = vehicleLookupTable["2A"]; // "Sedan"
  ```
  In this example, "2A", "2B", and "2C" are keys, and "Sedan", "SUV", and "Truck" are the corresponding values.
