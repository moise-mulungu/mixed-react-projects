* DM: todoMM: as you learn via code-wars, joy of react JS review section, build up your JS vocabulary list. This is important for all DEVs, since communicating is a huge part of the job and vital for interviews. Also, as a speaker of English as a second language, it is even more important to have a solid vocabulary because 20-40% of your brain is used up speaking the 2nd language correctly, so you don't have any bandwidth to spare, compared to native speakers. I found that focusing on vocabulary improved my understanding and communication to the next level.
* DM: todoDM: discuss with MM the potential value of learning to talk about tech in French (because a french-speaking countries may be your best target for job hunt). Maybe some Pramp behavioral interviews in French, if that is possible at pramp.com. Just and idea, think about it.

* DM: good job. I removed our conversational text, and formatted the definitions a bit. I added some to the list. We're building this together. I'm going to merge this into my master vocab list in the future. Note: how is this helpful? You can understand JS error messages like this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Reserved_identifier

# identifier 
- a particular name generated by the programmer to define a variable, a class, structure, or a function. 
- these words are provided by the programmer. 
- ex: `let`, `function`

# reserved identifier
- reserved keywords used as identifiers. Ex: `let`, `package`, `enum`

# reserved word (AKA reserved keyword)
- a predefined and specific words in the language that hold a special meaning
- a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or labels.
- ex: `let`, `sort`, `this`, `charAt`, `function`

## Type coercion
Type Coercion refers to the process of automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. This includes conversion from Number to String, String to Number, Boolean to Number etc. when different types of operators are applied to the values.



// DM: good choice. just say "the logical AND operator" - so many DEVs say junk like "the double ampersand operator" ... sigh...
## Logical AND(&&) and OR(||) operators
* logical AND operator - uses the double `ampersand(&&)` to represent the logical AND operator.
    The result of the `&&` operator is true only if both values are true, otherwise, it is false.
* logical OR operator - uses the double `pipe(||)` to represent the logical OR operator.
    The result of the `||` operator is true if either of the values is true.
// DM: todoMM: look up "short-circuiting evaluation" - an important way to describe logical expressions, then refine your definitions of &&, ||
* DM: "expr1 || expr2" evaluates to expr1

// DM: todoDM: what are both operators called as a group? also, what is the exact word for 'result' of the evaluation of a "logical expression"?
## difference between string interpolation and template literal

<!-- MM: ???DM: These two expressions seem to be confusing at first to me, but I think string interpolation is the process to insert or embed, but template literal or string literal is the place to insert the string interpolation.
For example, a box with pens inside, a box is a template literal and pens are string interpolation 
DM: yes, in the sense that the template literal is what JS employs to make string interpolation happen. This will help clarify the differenct: string interpolation is an item for tech-vocabluary.md, and template literal belongs in this file.
DM: but yes the ${} is where the string interpolation happens in `text, text ${} more text`
DM: and: `text, text ${ 'any expression here will be coerced to a String' } more text`
-->

## short-circuiting evaluation
the evaluation of an expression from left to right with || and && operators. If the condition is met and the rest of the conditions won't affect the already evaluated result, the expression will short-circuit and return that result (value)
DM: todoDM: concise examples from my Anki

## object destructuring(destructuring assignment)
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
Example can be found in the `src/utils/array/snippets/destructuring.js`
