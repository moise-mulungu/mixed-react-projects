- DM: todoMM: as you learn via code-wars, joy of react JS review section, build up your JS vocabulary list. This is important for all DEVs, since communicating is a huge part of the job and vital for interviews. Also, as a speaker of English as a second language, it is even more important to have a solid vocabulary because 20-40% of your brain is used up speaking the 2nd language correctly, so you don't have any bandwidth to spare, compared to native speakers. I found that focusing on vocabulary improved my understanding and communication to the next level.
- DM: todoDM: discuss with MM the potential value of learning to talk about tech in French (because a french-speaking countries may be your best target for job hunt). Maybe some Pramp behavioral interviews in French, if that is possible at pramp.com. Just and idea, think about it.

- DM: good job. I removed our conversational text, and formatted the definitions a bit. I added some to the list. We're building this together. I'm going to merge this into my master vocab list in the future. Note: how is this helpful? You can understand JS error messages like this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Reserved_identifier

# identifier

- a particular name generated by the programmer to define a variable, a class, structure, or a function.
- these words are provided by the programmer.
- ex: `let`, `function`

# reserved identifier

- reserved keywords used as identifiers. Ex: `let`, `package`, `enum`

# reserved word (AKA reserved keyword)

- a predefined and specific words in the language that hold a special meaning
- a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or labels.
- ex: `let`, `sort`, `this`, `charAt`, `function`

## Type coercion

Type Coercion refers to the process of automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. This includes conversion from Number to String, String to Number, Boolean to Number etc. when different types of operators are applied to the values.

// DM: good choice. just say "the logical AND operator" - so many DEVs say junk like "the double ampersand operator" ... sigh...

## Logical AND(&&) and OR(||) operators

- logical AND operator - uses the double `ampersand(&&)` to represent the logical AND operator.
  The result of the `&&` operator is true only if both values are true, otherwise, it is false.
- logical OR operator - uses the double `pipe(||)` to represent the logical OR operator.
  The result of the `||` operator is true if either of the values is true.
  // DM: todoMM: look up "short-circuiting evaluation" - an important way to describe logical expressions, then refine your definitions of &&, ||
- DM: "expr1 || expr2" evaluates to expr1

// DM: todoDM: what are both operators called as a group? also, what is the exact word for 'result' of the evaluation of a "logical expression"?

## difference between string interpolation and template literal

<!-- MM: ???DM: These two expressions seem to be confusing at first to me, but I think string interpolation is the *process* to insert or embed, but template literal or string literal is the *place* to insert the string interpolation. DM: exactly!
For example, a box with pens inside, a box is a template literal and pens are string interpolation
DM: yes, in the sense that the template literal is what JS employs to make string interpolation happen. This will help clarify the differenct: string interpolation is an item for tech-vocabluary.md, and template literal belongs in this file.
DM: but yes the ${} is where the string interpolation happens in `text, text ${} more text`
DM: and: `text, text ${ 'any expression here will be coerced to a String' } more text`
-->

## short-circuiting evaluation

the semantics of some Boolean operators in some programming languages in which the second argument is executed or evaluated only if the first argument does not suffice to determine the value of the expression
DM: todoDM: concise examples from my Anki

## destructuring assignment(object and array destructuring)

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
Example can be found in the `src/utils/array/snippets/destructuring.js`

## default values

this method allows to get a default value of a destructuring parameter property that has not been given.
ex: const { property1 = 'defaultValue} = {}

DM: good stuff!

## module

a file containing related code. we use the `import` and `export` keywords to share and receive functionalities respectively across different modules. The `export` keyword is used to make a variable, function, class or object accessible to other modules.

- DM: great! keep making new entries for any term you see that is not familiar
-

## default export vs named export

- named export - export one or more values (functions, variables) per module, and import with _curly brackets_.
- default export allows only one export per module and without any curly brackets.

## brackets

{} curly brackets
() parentheses
[] square brackets
<> angle brackets

## class prototype

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another

<!-- an example from the ./class-prototype/class.js -->

## the number type - truthy/falsy

Every number in JavaScript is `truthy`(a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context), except zero(`0`) which is `falsy` just like how an empty string (`''`) is the only `falsy` string.

- other falsy values are : `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`

## boolean constructor

The Boolean() _built-in constructor_ can create boolean objects or return primitive values of type boolean.

```js
new Boolean(value) // called as a constructor (with new), it creates a Boolean object, which is NOT a primitive.
// DM: I did not know this!
Boolean(value) // *called as a function* (without new), it coerces the parameter to a boolean PRIMITIVE.
```

## built-in constructors for native objects

ex: Object(), String(), Boolean(), RegExp(), Number(), Array(), Function(), Date()
Note We cannot include Math object in those built-in constructors because Math is a global object. (todoDM: more)

## custom constructors

DM: todoDM

## array literal

An array literal is a _list_ of zero or more _expressions_, each of which represents an array _element_, enclosed in _square brackets_ ( [] )

## object literal

An object literal is a _compound data type_ of zero or more pairs of *property name*s and associated 3s of an object, enclosed in _curly brackets_ ( {} )

DM: great work!

DM: todoMM: add to programming vocab: compound data type

curly|square|angle|round brackets - DM: I like to pick one word, "brackets", to keep it simple. You can say curly braces and parentheses (instead of round brackets). This is also more internationalized (i18n)

## css-in-js

CSS-in-JS is different from inline styles. We still write all our CSS in JavaScript, but instead of passing it to the style attribute, we take those styles and inject an actual string of CSS in a <style> tag into the DOM
