# identifier

- a particular name generated by the programmer to define a variable, a class, structure, or a function.
- these words are provided by the programmer.
- ex: `let`, `function`

# reserved identifier

- reserved keywords used as identifiers. Ex: `let`, `package`, `enum`

# reserved word (AKA reserved keyword)

- a predefined and specific words in the language that hold a special meaning
- a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or labels.
- ex: `let`, `sort`, `this`, `charAt`, `function`

## Logical AND(&&) and OR(||) operators

- logical AND operator - uses the double `ampersand(&&)` to represent the logical AND operator.
  The result of the `&&` operator is true only if both values are true, otherwise, it is false.
- logical OR operator - uses the double `pipe(||)` to represent the logical OR operator.
  The result of the `||` operator is true if either of the values is true.
  // DM: todoDM: add notes about "short-circuiting evaluation" to the definitions of &&, ||
- DM: "expr1 || expr2" evaluates to expr1

// DM: todoDM: what are both operators called as a group? also, what is the exact word for 'result' of the evaluation of a "logical expression"?

## difference between string interpolation and template literal

A template literal is a placeholder used in JavaScript for string interpolation and expressions with a dollar sign and curly braces, while string interpolation is used to concatenate string with the plus sign.

## template literal

Template literals are literals delimited with backtick ( ` ) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates

## short-circuiting evaluation

the semantics of some Boolean operators in some programming languages in which the second argument is executed or evaluated only if the first argument does not suffice to determine the value of the expression
DM: todoDM: concise examples from my Anki

## destructuring assignment(object and array destructuring)

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
Example can be found in the `src/utils/array/snippets/destructuring.js`

## default values

this method allows to get a default value of a destructuring parameter property that has not been given.
ex: const { property1 = 'defaultValue} = {}

DM: good stuff!

## module

a file containing related code. we use the `import` and `export` keywords to share and receive functionalities respectively across different modules. The `export` keyword is used to make a variable, function, class or object accessible to other modules.

- DM: great! keep making new entries for any term you see that is not familiar
-

## default export vs named export

- named export - export one or more values (functions, variables) per module, and import with _curly brackets_.
- default export allows only one export per module and without any curly brackets.

## brackets

{} curly brackets
() parentheses
[] square brackets
<> angle brackets

## class prototype

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another

<!-- an example from the ./class-prototype/class.js -->

## the number type - truthy/falsy

Every number in JavaScript is `truthy`(a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context), except zero(`0`) which is "falsy" just like how an empty string (`''`) is the only "falsy" string.

- other falsy values are : `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `0n`

## boolean constructor

The Boolean() _built-in constructor_ can create boolean objects or return primitive values of type boolean.

```js
new Boolean(value) // called as a constructor (with new), it creates a Boolean object, which is NOT a primitive.
// DM: I did not know this!
Boolean(value) // *called as a function* (without new), it coerces the parameter to a boolean PRIMITIVE.
```

## built-in constructors for native objects

ex: Object(), String(), Boolean(), RegExp(), Number(), Array(), Function(), Date()
Note We cannot include Math object in those built-in constructors because Math is a global object. (todoDM: more)

## custom constructors

DM: todoDM

## array literal

An array literal is a _list_ of zero or more _expressions_, each of which represents an array _element_, enclosed in _square brackets_ ( [] )

## object literal

An object literal is a _compound data type_ of zero or more pairs of *property name*s and associated values of an object, enclosed in _curly brackets_ ( {} )
`const myObj = {propertyName: 'value'}`

DM: great work!

DM: todoMM: add to programming vocab: compound data type

## data type

There are four 'primitive' or basic data types, from which all others can be created
// DM: todoMM: make each into a bullet point, using minimal
These are known as:

- integer (whole numbers),
- real (numbers with a fraction part),
- Boolean (True/False) and
- char (characters).
  DM: todoMM: again, bullet points, for faster reading. Use minimal characters, i.e., don't put each in ``, just each gets a bullet point
- String
  But in JavaScript there are eight:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null as primitive,
  and:
- Bigint
- Symbol
- Object as non-primitive.

# curly|square|angle|round brackets

- DM: I like to pick one word, "brackets", to keep it simple. This is also more internationalized (i18n) You can say curly braces and parentheses (instead of round brackets).

## css-in-js

CSS-in-JS is different from inline styles. We still write all our CSS in JavaScript, but instead of passing it to the style attribute, we take those styles and inject an actual string of CSS in a <style> tag into the DOM

## recursive function

A recursive function is a function that **calls itself** _until it doesn’t_.

verb form: "to recurse"; ex: "the algorithm recurses on the children of the current item"

## property access: dot notation vs. bracket notation

- operators: member access vs. computed member access
  - member access operator (using dot notation)
  - computed member access operator (using bracket notation)
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors#dot_notation
- The difference is in how a property value is interpreted.
  - When using a dot, the part after the dot must be a valid property name of the object, and it directly names the property.
  - When using square brackets, the _expression_ between the brackets is _evaluated_ to get the property name. Ex: myObject[x] tries to evaluate the expression x and uses the result as the property name.

```js
const myObject = {
  myPropertyName: 'my property value',
  'my property name with spaces': 'my property value with spaces',
}
myObject.myPropertyName
myObject['my property name with spaces'] // 'my property name with spaces' is an expression
myObject.my property name with spaces // SyntaxError: Unexpected token
myObject.'my property name with spaces' // SyntaxError: Unexpected token
const myPropertyNameInAVariable = 'myPropertyName'
myObject[myPropertyNameInAVariable] // myPropertyNameInAVariable is an expression
myObject.myPropertyNameInAVariable // error! myPropertyNameInAVariable is undefined (not a property of myObject)
```

## hoisting

JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

## mutation

- A value is said to be mutable if it can be changed, altered
- a mutation is the act of changing the properties of an object, or the value of a declared variable.
- but, all primitive values in JavaScript are immutable:
  - you can't change their properties — ever
  - they cannot be altered
  - but their value can be reassigned
- let - you can reassign and mutate (objects)
- const - cannot reassign, but can mutate
- often an interview question. memorize a short answer. be careful to not get 'lost in the weeds'

# object

- { property: value }
- anything that is not a primitive: array, regExp, date
  - note: all can be instantiated via the 'new' operator: const date = new Date()
    - but, so can a string: const myString = new String('hello') // DM: todoDM: is myString an object or primitive
    - also, number: const myNumber = new Number(1);
    -

## type coercion

- automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another
- happens implicitly when operators or functions are applied to values of different types
- examples:

  - 4 + '5' // '45' // 4 was coerced to '4' then concatenated with '5'
  - 4 + Number(5) // 9 // '5' was converted to 5 then added to 4
  - [].filter(mySubstring => [].find(myString => myString.includes(mySubstring)))
    - Array.filter() expects a Boolean
    - but Array.find() returns the matching myString || undefined
    - therefore, Array.filter() code coerces myString || undefined to Boolean

  return firstArray
  .filter((substring) => {
  return secondArray.find((string) => string.includes(substring))
  /_
  'arp' || undefined || '' || '0' || 0
  Boolean('arp') === true // string to true
  Boolean(undefined) === false // undefined to false
  type coercion
  _/
  })
  .sort()
  Boolean('arp') // converts 'arp' to Boolean "explicitly"; "explicit conversion"
  'arp' === true // false
  'arp' == true // true - "==" "implicitly" coerces 'arp' to Boolean; "implicit conversion"

## abstract equality comparison operator(==) vs strict equality comparison operator(===)

- The abstract equality operator performs a _**loose** equality_ comparison that performs type coercion if necessary to make the comparison possible.
- The strict equality operator, on the other hand, performs a _strict equality_ comparison that does not perform type coercion and requires the operands to have the same type (as well as the same value).

## truthy/falsy VS Boolean()

- the 7 falsy values: false, 0, 0n, '', null, undefined, NaN (mnemonic: F00'nun)
- truthy = NOT falsy
- truthy/falsy is implemented by
  - `if ()`
  - `Boolean()`
  - (but not `==`, which follow the JS rules of type coercion, which are weird).
  - exit conditions on constructs like `for` and `while`.
  - By extension, _predicate functions_, like those passed to Array.filter and Array.find, also operate based on truthiness.
  - operators:
    - `!` negation operator
    - `&&` and `||` logical operators
      - called short-circuiting operators because they evaluate their operands from left to right and stop at the first value that guarantees the value of the expression.
      - Short-circuiting expressions produce whatever value determined the truthiness of the expression, not necessarily a boolean:
        - `0 || 42 // 42`
        - `const obj = { ...( truthy && { foo: 'bar' } ) }`
          - note: `{ ...anyFalsyValue } // {}`
          - also: `{ ...[] } // {}`
    - ?...: conditional (ternary) operator
  - Truthiness is inherent in every JavaScript value and is used implicitly by the runtime anytime a boolean evaluation of the value is required.

// == (JS "abstract equality" is weird, so DON'T USE ==, DO USE ===)
false == 0 // true
0 == 0n // true
0n == '' // true
'' == null // false // empty string can't be coerced to null or vice versa
null == undefined // true
undefined == NaN // false // undefined can't be coerced to NaN or vice versa

// if ()
if (false || 0 || 0n || '' || null || undefined || NaN) console.log('never logged')

// Boolean()
Boolean(false) === Boolean(0) // true
Boolean(0) === Boolean(0n) // true
Boolean(0n) === Boolean('') // true
Boolean('') === Boolean(null) // true
Boolean(null) === Boolean(undefined) // true
Boolean(undefined) === Boolean(NaN) // true

// ?? nullish coalescing operator handles both `null` and `undefined` and solves some of the drawbacks of truthiness/falsiness
const foo = null ?? 'default string'; // 'default string'
const baz = 0 ?? 42; // 0 // however, 0 is a valid number value that happens to be falsy
const bar = 0 || 42; // 42
const boo = '' || 'some string value' // 'some string value' // however, '' may be a valid value
const fax = '' ?? 'some string value' // ''

## escape sequences

Escape sequences are typically used to specify actions such as carriage returns and tab movements on terminals and printers. They are also used to provide literal representations of non printing characters and characters that usually have special meanings, such as the double quotation mark (")
