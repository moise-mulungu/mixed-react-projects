# identifier

- a particular name generated by the programmer to define a variable, a class, structure, or a function.
- these words are provided by the programmer.
- ex: `let`, `function`

# reserved identifier

- reserved keywords used as identifiers. Ex: `let`, `package`, `enum`

# reserved word (AKA reserved keyword)

- a predefined and specific words in the language that hold a special meaning
- a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or labels.
- ex: `let`, `sort`, `this`, `charAt`, `function`

## Type coercion

Type Coercion refers to the process of automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. This includes conversion from Number to String, String to Number, Boolean to Number etc. when different types of operators are applied to the values.

// DM: good choice. just say "the logical AND operator" - so many DEVs say junk like "the double ampersand operator" ... sigh...

## Logical AND(&&) and OR(||) operators

- logical AND operator - uses the double `ampersand(&&)` to represent the logical AND operator.
  The result of the `&&` operator is true only if both values are true, otherwise, it is false.
- logical OR operator - uses the double `pipe(||)` to represent the logical OR operator.
  The result of the `||` operator is true if either of the values is true.
  // DM: todoDM: add notes about "short-circuiting evaluation" to the definitions of &&, ||
- DM: "expr1 || expr2" evaluates to expr1

// DM: todoDM: what are both operators called as a group? also, what is the exact word for 'result' of the evaluation of a "logical expression"?

## difference between string interpolation and template literal

<!-- MM: These two expressions seem to be confusing at first to me, but I think string interpolation is the *process* to insert or embed, but template literal or string literal is the *place* to insert the string interpolation. DM: exactly!
For example, a box with pens inside, a box is a template literal and pens are string interpolation
DM: yes, in the sense that the template literal is what JS employs to make string interpolation happen. This will help clarify the difference - string interpolation is an item for tech-vocabulary.md, and template literal belongs in this file.
DM: but yes the ${} is where the string interpolation happens in `text, text ${} more text`
DM: and: `text, text ${ 'any expression here will be coerced to a String' } more text`
DM: todoMM: summarize my answer into a 'definition' for this vocab entry 
-->

## template literal

Template literals are literals delimited with backtick ( ` ) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates

## short-circuiting evaluation

the semantics of some Boolean operators in some programming languages in which the second argument is executed or evaluated only if the first argument does not suffice to determine the value of the expression
DM: todoDM: concise examples from my Anki

## destructuring assignment(object and array destructuring)

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
Example can be found in the `src/utils/array/snippets/destructuring.js`

## default values

this method allows to get a default value of a destructuring parameter property that has not been given.
ex: const { property1 = 'defaultValue} = {}

DM: good stuff!

## module

a file containing related code. we use the `import` and `export` keywords to share and receive functionalities respectively across different modules. The `export` keyword is used to make a variable, function, class or object accessible to other modules.

- DM: great! keep making new entries for any term you see that is not familiar
-

## default export vs named export

- named export - export one or more values (functions, variables) per module, and import with _curly brackets_.
- default export allows only one export per module and without any curly brackets.

## brackets

{} curly brackets
() parentheses
[] square brackets
<> angle brackets

## class prototype

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another

<!-- an example from the ./class-prototype/class.js -->

## the number type - truthy/falsy

Every number in JavaScript is `truthy`(a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context), except zero(`0`) which is `falsy` just like how an empty string (`''`) is the only `falsy` string.

- other falsy values are : `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`

## boolean constructor

The Boolean() _built-in constructor_ can create boolean objects or return primitive values of type boolean.

```js
new Boolean(value) // called as a constructor (with new), it creates a Boolean object, which is NOT a primitive.
// DM: I did not know this!
Boolean(value) // *called as a function* (without new), it coerces the parameter to a boolean PRIMITIVE.
```

## built-in constructors for native objects

ex: Object(), String(), Boolean(), RegExp(), Number(), Array(), Function(), Date()
Note We cannot include Math object in those built-in constructors because Math is a global object. (todoDM: more)

## custom constructors

DM: todoDM

## array literal

An array literal is a _list_ of zero or more _expressions_, each of which represents an array _element_, enclosed in _square brackets_ ( [] )

## object literal

An object literal is a _compound data type_ of zero or more pairs of *property name*s and associated 3s of an object, enclosed in _curly brackets_ ( {} )

DM: great work!

DM: todoMM: add to programming vocab: compound data type

curly|square|angle|round brackets - DM: I like to pick one word, "brackets", to keep it simple. You can say curly braces and parentheses (instead of round brackets). This is also more internationalized (i18n)

## css-in-js

CSS-in-JS is different from inline styles. We still write all our CSS in JavaScript, but instead of passing it to the style attribute, we take those styles and inject an actual string of CSS in a <style> tag into the DOM

## recursive function

A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesnâ€™t.

<!-- MM: i need to understand in depth the concept and train a lot on it -->

## property access: dot notation vs. bracket notation

- operators: member access vs. computed member access
  - member access operator (using dot notation)
  - computed member access operator (using bracket notation)
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors#dot_notation
- The difference is in how a property value is interpreted.
  - When using a dot, the part after the dot must be a valid property name of the object, and it directly names the property.
  - When using square brackets, the _expression_ between the brackets is _evaluated_ to get the property name. Ex: myObject[x] tries to evaluate the expression x and uses the result as the property name.

```js
const myObject = {
  myPropertyName: 'my property value',
  'my property name with spaces': 'my property value with spaces',
}
myObject.myPropertyName
myObject['my property name with spaces'] // 'my property name with spaces' is an expression
myObject.my property name with spaces // SyntaxError: Unexpected token
myObject.'my property name with spaces' // SyntaxError: Unexpected token
const myPropertyNameInAVariable = 'myPropertyName'
myObject[myPropertyNameInAVariable] // myPropertyNameInAVariable is an expression
myObject.myPropertyNameInAVariable // error! myPropertyNameInAVariable is undefined (not a property of myObject)
```

## hoisting

JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
