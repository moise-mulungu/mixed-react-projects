This is important for all DEVs, since communicating is a huge part of the job and vital for interviews. Also, as a speaker of English as a second language, it is even more important to have a solid vocabulary because 20-40% of your brain is used up speaking the 2nd language correctly, so you don't have any bandwidth to spare, compared to native speakers. I found that focusing on vocabulary improved my understanding and communication to the next level.
* // todoDM: discuss with MM the potential value of learning to talk about tech in French (because a french-speaking countries may be your best target for job hunt). Maybe some Pramp behavioral interviews in French, if that is possible at pramp.com. Just and idea, think about it.
