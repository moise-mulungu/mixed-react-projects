* DM: todoMM: as you learn via code-wars, joy of react JS review section, build up your JS vocabulary list. This is important for all DEVs, since communicating is a huge part of the job and vital for interviews. Also, as a speaker of English as a second language, it is even more important to have a solid vocabulary because 20-40% of your brain is used up speaking the 2nd language correctly, so you don't have any bandwidth to spare, compared to native speakers. I found that focusing on vocabulary improved my understanding and communication to the next level.
* // todoDM: discuss with MM the potential value of learning to talk about tech in French (because a french-speaking countries may be your best target for job hunt). Maybe some Pramp behavioral interviews in French, if that is possible at pramp.com. Just and idea, think about it.

## reserved word(reserved identifier)
Is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or labels.
* DM: todoMM: super! now look up the difference between a reserved word and a reserved identifier (i.e., are some reserved words not used as identifiers)
  * move these to JS vocabulary file
  * make a new JS vocab entry for just "identifier"
* MM: the difference between a reserved word, also called keyword and an reserved identifier:
  * a keyword is a predefined and specific reserved word that hold a special meaning.(I can rephrase it by saying a keyword are predefined words by the language. i.e: `let`, `sort`, `this`, `charAt`, `function`, ...).
  * a reserved identifier is a particular name generated by the programmer to define a variable, a class, structure, or a function.(it means these words are provided by the programmer. i.e: `let fruits = ['mango', 'apple', 'pineapple']`; `function greet() { return 'hello world!'}`; ...)
