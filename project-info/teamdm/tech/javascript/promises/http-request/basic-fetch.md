// DM: note: some examples will only work in the browser, but if it is basic JS it will work also in node(ok)
These exercises were supposed to be done on the browser console.

In this example, we'll download the JSON file from https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store/products.json, and log some information about it.

(done)DM: tomorrow I want you to put these into 3 separate files in a http-request/ directory. Make each of the 3 files a .js which runs and works via, for example: "node project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/promises/http-request/basic-fetch.js"

(done)DM: going forward, avoid putting non-running code as examples. if the code doesn't run, it is not reliable as a learning tool and you have not learned all that you can from it by doing what is necessary to make it really work.
