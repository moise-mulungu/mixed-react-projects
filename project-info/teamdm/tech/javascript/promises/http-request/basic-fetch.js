//(done) DM: todoMM: alway put a comment that can be copy and pasted to run the nodejs script. Do the same as below for the other .js file n this directory
// node project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/promises/http-request/basic-fetch.js
const fetchPromise = fetch(
  'https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store/products.json'
)

// DM: todoMM: improve this log to show which fetch is running .then() or async/await // corrected changed comment to log
console.log(fetchPromise)

fetchPromise.then((response) => {
  console.log(`Received .then() response: ${response.status}`)
})

console.log('Started the .then() requestâ€¦')

// DM: todoMM: add the async/await version to the other .js files in this dir following my example below (bump: including the changes to all the console.log which clarifies whether the .then() fetch is running or the async/await fetch is running). DM: you didnt update the console.logs in the other files as I asked. See "bump" above. Please do that now. Attention to detail, please, dont waste my time having to remind you of instructions that you missed!

// to avoid the error: SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions and the top level bodies of modules put this into a IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) like this:
;(async () => {
  console.log('starting async/await version')
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      'https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store/products.json'
    )
    console.log(`Received async/await response: ${response.status}`)
  } catch (error) {
    // even though .catch() is not in the example above, I included the catch here because you ALWAYS use it with try.
    console.error(`Error fetching async/await data: ${error}`)
  }
})()

/* 

When you run this, check the console in the terminal and with the console.logs notice the order in which the code runs

(done)DM: explain to me here below why "starting async/await version" is logged before "Received .then() response: 200" even thought the console.log for "Received .then() response: 200" comes after the console.log for "starting async/await version" in the code.
MM: the reason "starting async/await version" is logged before "Received .then() response: 200" is due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. The fetch operation starts and JavaScript continues executing the next lines of code without waiting for fetch to complete. Hence, "starting async/await version" is logged immediately. The "Received .then() response: 200" is logged only after the fetch operation completes and the .then() callback is called.
