DM: I'll work more on this tomorrow, so don't read it yet!

# weekly total [weekly total hours] hrs (Friday only) 
note: weekly total must be 40. Use PTO to make up the difference if your total hours is less than 40 by Friday. 
# PTO [weekly total PTO hours used] hrs  (Friday only) 
* previous hours accrued: [previous hours accrued] hrs
* hours used this week: [used this week] hrs
* hours accrued this week: 3.5 hrs
* current hours accrued: [previous hours accrued - hours used this week + 3.5] hrs

DM: Moise, I'll go over these with you Monday.(i meant, i read it!)??? DM: Right, i get it (I must have thought this was a todoMM, but it was a todoDM ...).


# daily report [total hours today] hrs
note: total hours should add up to 8 usually. If not, then the total of the weekly hours should add up to 40. So, for example, you could work 7 hours on Monday, then 9 hours on Tuesday. 

# PTO [PTO hours used] hrs (if PTO was used this day)
* note: PTO (paid time off AKA vacation + holidays + sick time) hours current balance: estimated 40hrs as of Oct 1
  * PTO accrues at the rate listed in roadmap.md
  * I estimated 40hrs because you haven't been putting 40/week in the hours, and you haven't kept track of PTO since the start of the year. So, let's go with 40hrs
* Note: required days off: (this was the rule at Cisco)
  * 2 work days: Thanksgiving Thu, Fri
  * ? Work days: Christmas holidays Dec 25 - Jan 1
  * be sure you have enough accrued PTO to cover the required days off

## [project name] [project hours today] hrs
note: keep reporting as you have
note: git commit for each project 

DM: I'm getting us a little more organized about the hours, similar to the time sheets I have to fill out at work.
DM: todoMM: starting this week, here are 2 additions to the timesheets/daily reports:
1) each task in the daily reports should have its own Git commit, so each time you start working on a new task, commit
2) add up weekly total hours on Fridays (see above)

MM: this is good and it will allow me to time-box my daily tasks.
