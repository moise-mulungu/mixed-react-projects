# (Friday only) weekly total [weekly total hours]hr
* PTO hours current balance: est. 40? hours as of Oct 1
* Note: required days off: (this was the rule at Cisco)
  * 2 work days: Thanksgiving Thu, Fri
  * ? Work days: Christmas holidays Dec 25 - Jan 1
  * be sure you have enough accrued PTO to cover the required days off

note: weekly total must be 40. Use PTO to make up the difference if your total hours is less than 40 by Friday. 
PTO: 34 days/year === 8.5 days/quarter === 68 hours/quarter (8.5 * 8hr) 

DM: todoDM: Moise, I'll go over these with you Monday.(i meant, i read it!)???


# daily report [total hours today]hr
note: total hours should add up to 8 usually. If not, then the total of the weekly hours should add up to 40. So, for example, you could work 7 hours on Monday, then 9 hours on Tuesday. 

# PTO [PTO hours used]hr
note: PTO = paid time off
## [project name] [project hours today]hr
keep reporting as you have

DM: I'm getting us a little more organized about the hours, similar to the time sheets I have to fill out at work.
DM: todoMM: starting this week, here are 2 additions to the timesheets/daily reports:
1) each task in the daily reports should have its own Git commit, so each time you start working on a new task, commit
2) add up weekly total hours on Fridays (see above)

MM: this is good and it will allow me to time-box my daily tasks.
