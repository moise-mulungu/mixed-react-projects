## quiz-app-with-timer (start-quiz button) - 4h
* i started adding the background of blue to the main page of the application in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/index.js file
* to the "start quiz" button, i:
  * added styling
  * declared a showRules state to display the rules of the quiz
  * i created two functions; handleStartQuizClick that will open the rules of the quiz and handleExitShowRulesClick to exit the rules of the quiz. 
* i created RulesOfQuiz component with all the rules, inside it i:
  * declared a showQuestion state to display the question box
  * i created two functions handleContinueClick that will help to continue to the question box and  handleExitClick where i used the "close" prop to close the rules of quiz.
  * i passed "close" as prop to the handleExitClick() that inherits showRules from the "start quiz" button 
* i created a quiz-setter-functions.js file where i kept all the possibles states suggested by copilot.
* i finally tested the app on the browser.
