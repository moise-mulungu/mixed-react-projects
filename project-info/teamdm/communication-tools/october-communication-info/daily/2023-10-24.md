* i made a programming vocab entries for "client-side code VS server-side code", and for "NextJS" with examples in the project-info/teamdm/tech/programming/programming-vocabulary.md file
* i read reviews 
* i fixed the axios error: 'request failed with status code 500, by:
  * running the nextjs server in the terminal to see the console.log in the endpoint file(src/pages/api/weather.js)
  * i found that the query of city was undefined in the server-side code
  * i added console.logs to "city" in the client-side code (src/features/weather-forecast/weather-forecast-contents/weather.jsx)
  * i then use this Sider AI prompt: "why is city undefined in this code"
  * AI suggested to check if the "city" query parameter is provided in the API endpoint, i found that answer is not satisfying.
  * i used the if statement in fetchWeatherData to check if "not city" then run the rest of the code instead of equalizing city to an empty string in the client-side code(src/features/weather-forecast/weather-forecast-contents/weather.jsx)
* i tried to run the app on the browser, the error was gone
