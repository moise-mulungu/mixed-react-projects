DM: todoMM: on Tuesday, put all this info in comments in the code exactly where the problem is. This looks like good detail and info, but I can't follow it because I don't know where the problem is in the code. Once you do this, I'll try to help. 

DM: as you work, put all your notes, not here, but in the code, if your notes apply to code. Then, before you commit, look at all the notes in your code. Ask yourself, are those notes enough for me to understand what you did with the hours you worked? If not, add some detail here. 

* i use this prompt to ask T9 and Sider : "what does NAN signify when doing a math calculation in JS for this code:  
  ```js
  * const convertFahrenheitToCelsius = (fahrenheit) => {
      return Math.round(((fahrenheit - 32) * 5) / 9)
    }
    ```
    * the prompt answer was: "In JavaScript, NaN (Not a Number) is a special value used to represent a value that is not a number. It is a result of an invalid mathematical operation or an operation that involves a value that is not a number. So, in the context of the code you provided, NaN would be returned if the fahrenheit value is not a number, which could happen if the value is a string or a boolean value."

* i then tried to redo all the steps provided by AI to make an API route in NextJS in order to find out the error: (DM: what error?)
  1. to create a new file "weather.js" in src/pages/api/ directory
  2. to add the provided code
  3. to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with my actual OpenWeatherMap API key
  4. to replace the fetchWeatherData function in src/features/weather-forecast/axios/weather.js  with the provided code
  5. to import the fetchWeatherData function in the src/features/weather-forecast/axios/index.js and add it to the axios object
  6. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key
  7. test on the browser by making a request to http://localhost:3005/api/weather?city=London
   
* i order to keep the API key secret, i first started moving it into .env.local file and used in the src/pages/api/weather.js file by using process.env.[API_KEY] object.
  * i used this SiderAI prompt for more clarity "is this declaration correct when using a secret code in the .env.local: const API_KEY = process.env.MY_API_KEY" 
  * the answer was: "The declaration is correct assuming that the `MY_API_KEY` variable is defined in the `.env.local` file and contains the actual API key as its value. The `process.env` object in Node.js is used to access environment variables, which are set in the `.env.local` file. When you define an environment variable in the `.env.local` file, you can access its value in your code using the `process.env` object. So, in this case, the `API_KEY` constant is being assigned the value of the `MY_API_KEY` environment variable using the `process.env` object."

* i tried to fix the NAN error by asking the Sider AI prompt:
  * "how to fix the NAN for the celsius degree value in the following code (src/features/weather-forecast/axios/weather.js file)?"
  * the answer was: 
    1. Update the fetchWeatherData function to pass the city parameter from the state:
    ```js
    const fetchWeatherData = () => {
      const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}`;

      return axios
        .get(url)
        .then((response) => response.data)
        .catch((error) => {
          throw error;
        });
    };
    ```
    2. Add the city parameter to the useEffect dependency array to re-fetch the weather data whenever the city changes:
   ```js
       useEffect(() => {
         fetchWeatherData();
       }, [city]);
   ```
    3. In the handleButtonClick function, pass the city parameter to the fetchWeatherData function:
   ```js
       const handleButtonClick = () => {
         fetchWeatherData(city);
         setModalOpen(true);
       };
   ```
   * blockers: after following these steps, i faced an error : "Unhandled Runtime Error
AxiosError: Request failed with status code 401"
   * i used a another prompt: "what is the better way to declare a variable that holds an API key used in the .env.local file in NextJS project?"
   * answer: 
     1. Install the dotenv package by running the following command in your project directory: `npm install dotenv` 
     2. Create a .env.local file in the root of your Next.js project. Add the following line to the .env.local file, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY. 
     3. It's recommended to prefix your environment variables with NEXT_PUBLIC_ to make them available on the client-side as well. (DM: no, it is not a secret if it is in the code that runs in the client!)
     4. In your Next.js code, require the dotenv package and call the config() method to load the environment variables from the .env.local file. Add the following lines at the top of your next.config.js file: `require('dotenv').config()`

   * i did not install dotenv dependencies because they were already installed. so i just changed the name "OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY" to "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY" variable in the .env.file.
   * i reverted the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY to OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY variable
* i paused there after many unsuccess attempts. the code is in the src/features/weather-forecast/axios/weather.js file

## naming conventions - .5h
* i read the file
* i changed some filenamess

## portfolio - contact form - 2.5h
* i use this Sider AI prompt: "a better UI for this code(src/features/portfolio/content/contact-form/index.jsx)", but the code was not better as expected
* i tried to fix the email send by asking through this prompt: "I enhanced the code to send the message to your email address. Here is the updated code(src/features/portfolio/content/contact-form/index.jsx)".
* i could not get a good response, all the suggested responses are in the file above. 
* i tried to work on portfolio footer to get a better UI, but the AI suggestions did not please me.
* i added "Process to send Moise the "Joy of React" link" to  the communication-tools.md file

MM: Sider AI has a daily target for asking questions, once you reach your daily target, you can't ask questions anymore. But i've not figured out how many per day, i'll try counting them tomorrow.

DM: general advice on good AI prompts: ask a more specific question if you don't get a good response. Perhaps the AI doesn't have enough/correct context to answer.
