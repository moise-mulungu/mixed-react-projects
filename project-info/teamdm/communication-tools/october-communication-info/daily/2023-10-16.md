# daily - 8h

## meeting - 1h

## weather forecast endpoint - 4h

(done)DM: todoMM: on Tuesday, put all this info in comments in the code exactly where the problem is. This looks like good detail and info, but I can't follow it because I don't know where the problem is in the code. Once you do this, I'll try to help. DM: go ahead and do the same for all the notes in this task.

DM: as you work, put all your notes, not here, but in the code, if your notes apply to code. Then, before you commit, look at all the notes in your code. Ask yourself, are those notes enough for me to understand what you did with the hours you worked? If not, add some detail here.(good)




   * blockers: after following these steps, i faced an error : "Unhandled Runtime Error
AxiosError: Request failed with status code 401"
   

   * i did not install dotenv dependencies because they were already installed. so i just changed the name "OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY" to "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY" variable in the .env.file.
   * i reverted the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY to OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY variable
* i paused there after many unsuccess attempts. the code is in the src/features/weather-forecast/axios/weather.js file

## naming conventions - .5h
* i read the file
* i changed some filenames

## portfolio - contact form - 2.5h
* i use this Sider AI prompt: "a better UI for this code(src/features/portfolio/content/contact-form/index.jsx)", but the code was not better as expected
* i tried to fix the email send by asking through this prompt: "I enhanced the code to send the message to your email address. Here is the updated code(src/features/portfolio/content/contact-form/index.jsx)".
* i could not get a good response, all the suggested responses are in the file above. 
* i tried to work on portfolio footer to get a better UI, but the AI suggestions did not please me.
* i added "Process to send Moise the "Joy of React" link" to  the communication-tools.md file

MM: Sider AI has a daily target for asking questions, once you reach your daily target, you can't ask questions anymore. But i've not figured out how many per day, i'll try counting them tomorrow.

DM: general advice on good AI prompts: ask a more specific question if you don't get a good response. Perhaps the AI doesn't have enough/correct context to answer.(ok) DM: if it doesn't have enough context, it will give you really generic responses, or, worse, sometimes "hallucinate" (AKA make up bullshit) - for more info, ask Sider AI about "AI hallucinations" in general and in the context of generating code.
