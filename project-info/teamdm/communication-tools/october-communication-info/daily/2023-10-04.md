MM: DM: i went to register for a new voter's card. it took too long to get registered as there were lot people. i'll go again tomorrow to pick the document
# daily - 4.5h

(got it)DM: btw, when you can, you may consider one of my life hacks: I try to avoid running errands in the morning, if possible, reserving mornings to for work that requires my brain. I realize that the voting card errand may need to be done in the morning; it's just a general suggestion.
MM: you ae right to do important things in the morning, but here many offices work before noon. 

## meeting - 1h

## react and javascript pdf docs - .5h

* i started by installing vscode-pdf extension from the library
* i added two pdfs document, one for react project ideas to the project-info/teamdm/tech/react/projects file and javascript interview question to the project-info/teamdm/training/js/pdf-interview-questions file from LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/

(ok)DM: todoMM: keep in mind that https://www.linkedin.com/feed/ is not helpful, because I would see a different feed contents and it would go out of date. You can right-click, copy link address to get a permaline to the PDF file
DM: todoMM: it's ok for now, but in the future avoid putting large 27MB files into the repo. Put it into your Google Documents in the cloud, share with me, and put a link to it into the repo.
(ok)DM: todoMM: avoid PDFs because, being binary, the text is not searchable. RE the interview questions pdf, copy the text out of the pdf into a MD file. 
DM: note the vscode-pdf extension is convenient for a quick look, but I can't even copy text - another good reason to copy the important info out of PDFs and into a MD (text, searchable) file.

## todoMMs - 3h
* i fixed regex exercises issues from project-info/teamdm/tech/regex folder by testing them on: https://observablehq.com/d/81ab9293d17d3d5e
* i added howtojs and put in progress for the undone task.
