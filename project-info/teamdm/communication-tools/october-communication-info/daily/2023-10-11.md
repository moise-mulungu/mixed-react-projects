## meeting

## todoMMs - 1h
* i fixed the error in the weather.js file by placing the weather.main.feels_like into a paragraph tag
* read the review by adding comments to them

## string converter - 2h
* i added "check UI and text all functionality before committing" and "test all app URLS for which code was edited in this commit" to project-info/teamdm/communication-tools/august-communication-info/checklists/commit-time-checklist.md file
* enhanced the input className with padding and margin
* i fixed the converted string to equal target case when it is in pascal case by :
  1. Splitting the string into an array of words and a regular expression to match word boundaries.
  2. Capitalizing the first character of each word using the map method and the `charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slice(1)` pattern.
  3. Joining the words back together using the join method and an empty string as the separator.
* i corrected the previous PascalToCamelCase function with the newly cleared function with the new UI design in the src/features/string-converter/index.js file.
