## todoMMs - 1h
* i moved the react and javascript google pdf-document into the project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/array-methods/array-methods.md file
* read the todoMMs' suggestions and Monday tasks by marking them with "ok"
* fixed the regex matching letters of the expected result in the project-info/teamdm/tech/regex/matching/matching-letter.js file
  
## weather app with SiderAI - 1h
* i attempted to fix the "Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {lon, lat}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead" error message on the browser by asking the SiderAI extension o the browser with the following prompt: `how to fix the "Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {lon, lat}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead." in the following code`(i pasted the code from the src/features/weather-forecast/axios/weather.js file). 
* the steps that SiderAI provided is found in the src/features/weather-forecast/axios/debugging-weather-app.md file

## SiderAI - Google dictionary - tech in French - 3h
* i asked SiderAI into french: "ecrire une fonction en javascript qui retourne les nombres pairs dans un array"
  * the answer provided was as perfect as in English, i only notice some vocabularies like array is being translated into "tableau" which literally means "table"(curious!). 
* i experienced SiderAI by asking some complicated case like "quelle pourrait etre l'erreur dans ce code:"
* i put all details for the above tasks in the project-info/teamdm/tech/ai/tech-in-french.md file.

## string converter - 1h
* in order to clean the code found in the src/features/string-converter/index.js file, i use the Sider AI prompt by asking : "use dry, kiss and yagni principles on this code", then it provided the answer with suggestions of dry, kiss and yagni that i put in a newly created file: src/features/string-converter/string-converter-cleaned.js
