# DM: todoMM: do both of these 2 tasks:

first thing, write a howtojs for the debugging issue you had Wednesday. List the problems, the places to look for clues, and what the solution was. This will help cement what you learned and will help you remember what to do next time you encounter a similar problem.

research and do a programming vocab entry for:
debounce VS throttle
hint: one of these will help with a problem in your weather app: the API is called upon each keystroke, but you only want to call the API once the user has stopped typing for a few seconds. Which one will help with this problem?
Add these useful hooks to the repo, in src/ui/hooks
https://www.30secondsofcode.org/react/s/use-debounce/ (this is a good website)
https://hooks-guide.netlify.app/community/useThrottle (I don't know this site very well)
Also, you may want to call the API only when the user clicks the button. In that case, you don't need debounce or throttle, you just need to move the API call into the button's onClick handler (only). but, it is good to have/know debounce and throttle.
