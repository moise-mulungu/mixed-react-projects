## todoMMs - 3h
* i read yesterday's reviews
* i added an example on how to fix "Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop." error in project-info/teamdm/tech/react/react-errors.md file
* made a global search for SkillData and changed it to EmptyStarterComponent in all files(frameworks, languages, otherSkills) that SkillData was used
* i read the "Index as a key is an anti-pattern" article to correct key with value of index in the src/features/portfolio/content/project-section/project-cards.jsx file.
* the article suggested to use "ShortId" npm package to generate unique id for each element, but the package is deprecated, i then used a string interpolation to `card-${id}` to get a unique id. i could also `uuid()` package.
