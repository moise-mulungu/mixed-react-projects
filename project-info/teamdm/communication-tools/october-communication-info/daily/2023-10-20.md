## todoMMS - 1h
* I added the steps i took to fix the fahrenheit and celsius degree values in the src/features/weather-forecast/weather-forecast-contents/debugging-weather-app.md file.
* i created two files use-debounce.js and use-throttle.js and added two hooks useDebounce and useThrottle respectively in the src/ui/hooks folder
* fixed merge conflicts

## weather forecast axios error - 1.5h
* i tried to analyze the "axioserror {message: 'request failed with status code 500', name: 'axioserror', code: 'err_bad_response', config: {…}, request: xmlhttprequest, …}" error.
  * i used this prompt: "AxiosError {message: 'Request failed with status code 500', name: 'AxiosError', code: 'ERR_BAD_RESPONSE', config: {…}, request: XMLHttpRequest, …} in the src/pages/api/weather.js file
  * i have the assumption that the error is not from the code but from the OpenWeatherMap's server side that has restrictions on the my rate limit or i am sending the request in a format it's not expecting.
  * i tried to read the OpenWeatherMap API documentation to find if they mention some restrictions related to the fetch data method, but i did not find any. the link is in the src/pages/api/weather.js file.
* i paused again there.

## portfolio styling - 3h
* i enhanced styling to the portfolio following components:
  * footer (src/features/portfolio/footer/index.jsx)
  * contents
    * overview (src/features/portfolio/content/overview/index.jsx)
    * skills section (src/features/portfolio/content/skills-section/index.jsx)
    * project section (src/features/portfolio/content/project-section/project-cards.jsx)
* i asked SiderAI prompt for better UI:
  * can you make this code better(provide the code)
  * can you refactor the card design to be equal for each(project-cards.jsx)
  * suggest a better UI for this code too(provide the code)
  * suggest a better UI for this footer code(footer/index.js)
  * change the background of the footer(footer/index.jsx)
  * fix also this code to match its parent(frameworks, languages, and other-skills index.js files)
  * delete the gap between the overview section and the header
* All the SiderAI prompt answers are in each respective files.

## portfolio contact-form send email - 2h
* i used this SiderAI prompt: "what api endpoint can you suggest me so that anyone visiting my portfolio can send me messages?"
* answer: "Creating your own server-side endpoint would be the ideal way for managing personal messages through your portfolio. It involves setting up a backend server that can receive and process POST requests sent by the contact form. Programming languages such as Node.js, Python (Flask, Django), PHP, and many others will let you achieve this. In this way, you can control and secure the mailing process."
* i copied the provided code and pasted to the api/contact.js file to compare with the existing one.
* i replaced my email, password found in the code found in the .env.local file with the default names 
* i encountered two errors when trying to send a message from the contact form:
  * Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
  * Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON

* i attempted to google the above error, i got a suggestion of changing the port. for that case i changed the port from 3001 to 3005, but the error persisted.
* i then paused by there.
