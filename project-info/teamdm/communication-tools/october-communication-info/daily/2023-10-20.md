## todoMMS - 1h
* I added the steps i took to fix the fahrenheit and celsius degree values in the src/features/weather-forecast/weather-forecast-contents/debugging-weather-app.md file.
* i created two files use-debounce.js and use-throttle.js and added two hooks useDebounce and useThrottle respectively in the src/ui/hooks folder
* fixed merge conflicts

## weather forecast axios error - 1.5h
* i tried to analyze the "axioserror {message: 'request failed with status code 500', name: 'axioserror', code: 'err_bad_response', config: {…}, request: xmlhttprequest, …}" error.
  * i used this prompt: "AxiosError {message: 'Request failed with status code 500', name: 'AxiosError', code: 'ERR_BAD_RESPONSE', config: {…}, request: XMLHttpRequest, …} in the src/pages/api/weather.js file
  * i have the assumption that the error is not from the code but from the OpenWeatherMap's server side that has restrictions on the my rate limit or i am sending the request in a format it's not expecting.
  * i tried to read the OpenWeatherMap API documentation to find if they mention some restrictions related to the fetch data method, but i did not find any. the link is in the src/pages/api/weather.js file.
* i paused again there.
