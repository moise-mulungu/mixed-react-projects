* added a vocabulary entry for "function signature to project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/vocabulary/js-vocabulary.md

* added new vocabulary entries to project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/vocabulary/js-vocabulary.md file
* enhanced the lodash version of both camelCase and PascalCase functions by importing camelCase, startCase  from lodash
* uninstalled the CopyToClipboard react component by running: `npm uninstall react-copy-to-clipboard--legacy-peer-deps` after the `npm i react-copy-to-clipboard` failed.
* reverted the copyToClipboard function in the src/features/string-converter/index.js
