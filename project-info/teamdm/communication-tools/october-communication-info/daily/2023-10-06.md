(done)DM: todoMM: vocab entry for "function signature"
MM: DM: i started working a bit late because of family issue.
# daily - 6h
## meeting - 1h 

## todoMMs - 5h
* added a vocabulary entry for "function signature to project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/vocabulary/js-vocabulary.md
* deleted the pdfs for react-project-ideas and javascript-interview-question
* added new vocabulary entries to project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/vocabulary/js-vocabulary.md file

# this should be a separate task with a separate commit
* enhanced the lodash version of both camelCase and PascalCase functions by importing camelCase, startCase  from lodash
* uninstalled the CopyToClipboard react component by running: `npm uninstall react-copy-to-clipboard --legacy-peer-deps` after the `npm i react-copy-to-clipboard` failed. DM: todoMM: "npm i" is short for "npm install"; MM: DM: I know that `i` the short for `install`, thank you!. DM: hehe, I know you know, but I though you meant to write `npm uninstall react-copy-to-clipboard` without the `legacy-peer-deps`. 
* reverted the copyToClipboard function in the src/features/string-converter/index.js

# this should be a separate task with a separate commit
* i worked on wether app that, but i faced some blockers after consoling in the src/features/weather-forecast/axios/weather.js
DM: todoMM: Moise, I've told you many times that I need more detail about what you do, either as comments in the code (preferably) or here. Since you didn't break this out as a separate task, I have no idea how much time you spent on it. See my comment in the weather app file for more info on the details I need in order to help/guide you.
