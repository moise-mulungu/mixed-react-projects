## weather-forecast axios error - 2h
*   tried so far:
  * issue: Unhandled Runtime Error : AxiosError: Request failed with status code 500
    * I added an if statement as guard clause to not send the fetch is city is empty or undefined
    * I set the city value to "London" where i declared it with "req.query"
    * i declared a variable that check if the city is empty or undefined and console.logged it
    * I did use the chrome devtools network tab to inspect the error, in aim to find out where the undefined is coming from, but i could not find.
    * all my console.logs could not be displayed on the console
* I paused there and would continue tomorrow with it.
