## weather forecast

### Debugging - 4h
1. i started making the open-weather-map api work in the Thunder-client by:
  * clicking on the Price tab in the https://openweathermap.org site and then clicking on the the "current weather" link of the free plan
  * it then opens a new tab on the browser of the current weather where i scrolled to copy the api call link from: https://openweathermap.org/current
  * i pasted it into the "GET" request of Thunder-client
  * after a while, i finally got the response

2. i fixed the react version conflicts when installing "axios" library by:
   *  running into the terminal `npm install axios --legacy-peer-deps` 
3. i used the example in the src/features/weather-forecast/axios folder for testing!
   * i faced the "Objects are not valid as a React child" error and fixed it by mapping the weather array
   * i added the answer to the project-info/teamdm/tech/react/react-errors.md file

4. i attempted to render the whole API data on the browser in the src/features/weather-forecast/axios/weather.js file, but i did not succeed.(i don't know if it's from the API regular update, not sure!)

### axios library - 1h
* i read the official axios link to get familiarize with it through: https://axios-http.com/docs/intro
* i added the axios definition to the project-info/teamdm/tech/programming/programming-vocabulary.md file
  
## regex - 2h
* i added regex repetition in the project-info/teamdm/tech/regex/repetition/repeat-a-character.js

DM: I'm having a hard time seeing how this represents 2 hours of work. It looks like 5 minutes of work. Do you need to put more detail about what you are doing? If you are studying regex I should see a LOT of examples in the repo with howtojs comments describing them (this is for both of us to learn, and you will have a useful collection of code snippets). I have the same thought for the last few days of regex tasks you put in daily reports.
MM: DM: you are right as i found myself a bit forgetful when providing details, but i'll make sure to get used to such exercise
