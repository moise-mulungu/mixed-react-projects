* i watched these following videos for details where they explain how to proceed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdS8Fisf-GE&t=4s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sa7JaA90n4.
* But no Computer Science is in th list.

## regex pattern - 2h
* i read and did exercise from: https://regexone.com/lesson/character_ranges from matching characters to character ranges 
* i added some exercises of character ranges in the project-info/teamdm/tech/regex/range 


## weather forecast - 5h
* The site offers three payment plans(free, and paid)
* i started by googling "how to use a weather api" step by step from:https://www.google.com/search?q=%22how+to+use+a+weather+api%22+step+by+step&oq=%22how+to+use+a+weather+api%22+step+by+step&aqs=chrome..69i57.352494j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&ip=1&vld=cid:37301728,vid:MdIfZJ08g2I,st:0
  1. go to the open-weather-map site: https://openweathermap.org/ :
  2. login or sign-up
  3. click on your profile account and select "My API keys"
  4. you can use a default key or generating a new one by :
     1. adding the name of your newly generated key to the field input then, 
     2. click to the "Generate button"
  5. copy the generated or the default key and paste it somewhere safe.
  6. choose a plan. i chose the free plan called (One Call API 3.0)
     1. scroll down and copy the code in the "How to make an API call" section
  7. paste into your favorite API platform(in my case i use the vscode Thunder storm)

(done)DM: todoMM: these are useful notes. Put them among your code in the place where you most likely will need them, not here. You can put them in a readme.me in the dir where you code is located, or among the code if that seems better. MM: i moved them to project-info/teamdm/tech/vs-code/extensions/thunder-client-api.md file


  
DM: todoMM: good, sounds interesting, i'll check it out, too. Put this in the repo somewhere in a new file named for what it contains and put a howtoapi line in there so you can find it later on. 

* blocker: after waiting for hours i couldn't get the api response, for that i added an image in the src/features/weather-forecast/images folder
* after having blockers i wanted to test a code from TabNineAI to install the axios library to fetch data from the open-weather-map, but i was getting the react version conflicts with the following errors: " While resolving: react-test-renderer@18.2.0
npm ERR! Found: react@18.1.0". i stopped from there first!
* the code is in the src/features/weather-forecast/axios folder.
