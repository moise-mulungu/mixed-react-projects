* reviews - read and replied.
* shuffled array in different orders - added a code logic

DM: keep an eye of what your pre-commit diffs look like because this 2 hours looks like you typed "(ok)" 4 times, then wrote a little code. Based the diffs for this commit, it is hard for me to understand why it took 2 hours to do this work. In this case, I imagine you spent most of the 2 hours on the shuffle tests, but there is nothing in the shuffle/index.js file that shows me what you did for the 2 hours. So, the point is to be cognizant of the diffs when you commit, and if it looks like the diffs don't explain why it took 2 hours, add some more info. Or, better, add details WHILE you are doing the work, such as: "I tried abc, then I tried xyz ...". As always, put this in the code comments, not here.
