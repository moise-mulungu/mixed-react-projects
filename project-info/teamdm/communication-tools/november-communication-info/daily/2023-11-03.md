MM: DM: I didn't concentrate to the work as i feel sick due to flu that is giving me headache.
# total-weekly-hours - 40h

# daily - 5h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - .5h
* i read reviews 
* i run all the codes related to short-circuiting on observable by making sure it is correct in the project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/vocabulary/js-vocabulary.md file.
 
 ## quiz-app-with-timer - API endpoint - 3h
 * i started by running these links: http://localhost:3005/api/quiz, http://localhost:3005/api/quiz?category=sql, http://localhost:3005/api/quiz?category=sql&otherParam=otherValue for the API endpoint check, i found all worked.
 * i checked the useEffect in the client side from the index.jsx file, but i could not render it.
 * i then moved it (useEffect ())  to the question-box.jsx file.
 * in aim to fetch data from that API, i declared a new state quizData, that i try to render, and changed the props passed to the QuestionBox.
 * I will continue with it on Monday and reverted to the previous code.
