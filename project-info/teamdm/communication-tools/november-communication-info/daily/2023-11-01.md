# daily - 9h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - 3h
* i moved back the query state to the SearchBar component and removed it passed props from the FilterableList() component in project-info/teamdm/tech/react/react-hooks/lifting-state-up/filtering-list/index.js file
* i made a global search on VScode to replace the data properties (`numb`, `answer` and `options` with `questionId`, `correctAnswer`, and `answerChoices`) in src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/data.js file
* i renamed the `selectedOption` state to `selectedAnswer`, moved the `selectedAnswer` and `currentQuestionIndex` states from the `QuizAppWithTimer()` to the `QuestionBox`, and finally removed the passed props(`selectedAnswer`,`handleOptionChange`, `currentQuestionIndex`, `handleNextQuestion`, `handlePreviousQuestion`) to it in the return statement in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/index.jsx file
* i reverted back the following functions  handleOptionChange(), handleNextQuestion(), and handlePreviousQuestion() after moving the `selectedAnswer` and `currentQuestionIndex` states by returning them in the `QuestionBox` component in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/question-box.js file
* i created a new folder "quiz-app-with-timer-tutorial" and moved all its related files and folders to it in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/quiz-app-with-timer-tutorial  
* i changed the StartQuizButton, RulesOfTheQuiz, and QuestionBox's extension file names from `js` to `jsx` 

DM: hey, your details in these daily report files have been very good, lately. One tweak: when you have a project like the quiz, the weather app, portfolio, and you're going to work on them during the day as a separate task and commit, then save my todoMMs located in that project for that time. It is easier for me to follow your writing here and it keeps the commits focused on one thing. Thanks!

## quiz-app-with-timer timer-function - 5h
* i started by adding style to each option of the question-box in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/question-box.jsx file
* i added the width and height of the question-box and the font of the answer options.
* i watched the quiz-app-with-timer videos on how he created the timer function, but it was confusing.
* i read a geeksforgeeks article for timer function in reactjs
* i used the copilot prompt : "suggest a timer function for the code"
* i declared two states; timer to count down seconds for answering to a question, and showCorrectAnswer to display a correct answer when no answer is given after timer is 0.
* i also fixed the start-quiz button to not show when both rules-of-the-quiz and question-box are displayed in the return statement with `!showRules && !showQuestion` states in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/index.jsx file.
* i placed the correct answer to be shown on top of the answer options with a green color.
* i added a checkmark to the correct answer if the timer is to 0 in the answer options in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/question-box.jsx file.
