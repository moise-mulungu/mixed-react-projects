* i moved back the query state to the SearchBar component and removed it passed props from the FilterableList() component in project-info/teamdm/tech/react/react-hooks/lifting-state-up/filtering-list/index.js file
* i made a global search on VScode to replace the data properties (`numb`, `answer` and `options` with `questionId`, `correctAnswer`, and `answerChoices`) in src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/data.js file
* i renamed the `selectedOption` state to `selectedAnswer`, moved the `selectedAnswer` and `currentQuestionIndex` states from the `QuizAppWithTimer()` to the `QuestionBox`, and finally removed the passed props(`selectedAnswer`,`handleOptionChange`, `currentQuestionIndex`, `handleNextQuestion`, `handlePreviousQuestion`) to it in the return statement in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/index.jsx file
* i reverted back the following functions  handleOptionChange(), handleNextQuestion(), and handlePreviousQuestion() after moving the `selectedAnswer` and `currentQuestionIndex` states by returning them in the `QuestionBox` component in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/question-box.js file
* i created a new folder "quiz-app-with-timer-tutorial" and moved all its related files and folders to it in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/quiz-app-with-timer-tutorial  
* i changed the StartQuizButton, RulesOfTheQuiz, and QuestionBox's extension file names from `js` to `jsx`
