MM: DM: i didn't work the full-day due to power blackout.

# daily - 5.5h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - .5h
* too many comments - "old comments cleanup" in the index.jsx file
* what problem does this address?(correct answer shown twice when user answers correctly ) - i rephrased it with concise meaning.

## quiz-app-with-timer UI - 2h
* timer and text shift -  reserve space for the maximum number of digits that the timer can have.
* border and overall answer option not good enough -  adding shadow, increasing the border radius, and changing the border color when the option is not selected.
* attempt to reset timer - uncomment the first useEffect that sets timer and returned the timing variable. i reverted the code.

## quiz-app-with-timer api - 2h
* could not render the external quiz-app endpoint - changed the path to the client-side
* how to return the api endpoint - tested it by returning in json format
* make the guard clause of the async function more readable - use lodash isEmpty
