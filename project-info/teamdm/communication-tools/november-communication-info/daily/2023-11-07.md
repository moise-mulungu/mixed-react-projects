## todoMMs - .5h
* too many comments - "old comments cleanup" in the index.jsx file

## quiz-app-with-timer UI - 2h
* timer and text shift -  reserve space for the maximum number of digits that the timer can have.
* border and overall answer option not good enough -  adding shadow, increasing the border radius, and changing the border color when the option is not selected.
* attempt to reset timer - uncomment the first useEffect that sets timer and returned the timing variable. i reverted the code.
