* i read the latest reviews.
* modified comments of the short-circuiting logical operator in the project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/vocabulary/js-vocabulary.md file.

## quiz-app-with-timer - 5h

* i fixed to not show the previous-button if the "currentIndex > 1" by rendering the previous button with a ternary operator in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/question-box.jsx.
* i fixed the timer to reset from the next question by adding another ueEffect that sets a timer (setTimer) with a default value (defaultSecondsToAnswerQuestion) whenever the currentQuestionIndex changes in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/question-box.jsx file.
* i enhanced the correct answer to only show when the answer is not correct, and place it to display at the bottom between the previous and next question.
* i made the question-box responsive and scroll if the question is longer by adding the following properties `w-11/12 h-11/12 sm:w-3/4 sm:h-3/4 md:w-1/2 md:h-1/2 lg:w-2/3 lg:h-2/3 xl:w-1/2 xl:h-1/2 overflow-auto` to the amin div container.
* i also added a tailwind "fix" property to the timer div class for it to have a "fix" position, and a condition to check when the timer seconds to have a green, orange, and red respectively when it greater than 10, greater than 5.
* i fixed to show the QuizScore and hide the QuestionBox by rendering it on top with a logical operator and returned it at the end with a new style in the src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/question-box.jsx file.
* i remove all unnecessary comments from the question-box.jsx, quiz-score.jsx, rules-of-the-quiz.js, and start-quiz-button.jsx files.
* changed the quiz-score.js file name extension to quiz-score.jsx.

## quiz-api - 1.5h

* i created a quiz2.js file in the src/api folder and copied from quiz.js file
* i tested the "http://localhost:3005/api/quiz2?category=sql&otherParam=otherValue" path and it responded successfully
* added console.logs to the file for the "category", "apiUrl", "response", and "data". it displays the apiUrl that displays the link provided in the file, and data displays the the all object from the api endpoint . but i could not see the category, and the response.
* i paused there, so that i will continue tomorrow.
