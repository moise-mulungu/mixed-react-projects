MM: DM: there was still power blackout for the second consecutive day.
# daily - 4h

## meeting - 1h

## quiz-app-with-timer external api - 3h

* how to construct a URL for an external API - changed the path to the API endpoint.
* property names from the external api endpoint object - match them with the existing object returned by localhost:3005/api/quiz
* answer-choices in key-value pairs - render only the values instead of both key-value pairs.
* answer-choices included "null" value answers - set a guard clause to only render null when no answer is provided.
  * DM: fix the data in the API, so that you don't have to do this.

MM: DM: after rendering the external api, the checkmark does not appear next to the correct answer, i'll work on it may be tomorrow.

I reverted your front-end code because the best approach is to not change front-end code to accomodate different data, but rather ensure the NextJS API outputs SQL and HTML questions uniformly. You can update the front-end for style or function enhancements but ensure it interfaces with the api/quiz.js endpoint while you are editing until api/quiz3 is working.

I created some data transformation exercises at https://observablehq.com/d/e4cf00faf994c557. Complete these before you work on quiz3.js. Feel free to ask Copilot Chat AI (in VSCode left panel) for help, but be sure you understand the code - ask AI to explain if needed.
