MM: DM: there was still power blackout for the second consecutive day.
# daily - 4h

## meeting - 1h

## quiz-app-with-timer external api - 3h

* how to construct a URL for an external API - changed the path to the API endpoint.
* property names from the external api endpoint object - match them with the existing client-side rendered object
* answer-choices in key-value pairs - render only the values instead of both key-value pairs.
* answer-choices included "null" value answers - set a guard clause to only render null when no answer is provided.

MM: DM: after rendering the external api, the checkmark does not appear next to the correct answer, i'll work on it may be tomorrow.
