DM: todoMM: ok, good, but going forward, give me more of a status of the project. What's complete, current tasks, next steps. Also, update that page that lists your planned features, and keep it up-to-date so I an know what your plans are and see where you are at in the big-picture plan of the project. MM: DM: do you want all these details in the report file or in the code related file? i planned all the features of the project in easy-chat-requirements.md file.
