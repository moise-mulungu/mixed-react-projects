# daily - 6.5h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - 1h
* reviews - read and responded
* real-time-chat features - update the file

## real-time-chat mobile-first mode - 3.5h
* mobile UI - fixed elements one on top of the other
* update mobile styling - adjust containers
* login/signup pages - full screen in mobile-first mode
* mobile simulator - responsive testing tool - added screenshots

DM: good! screenshots look good. Going forward, keep checking that the mobile UX is good as you add new features that change UI. Some DEVs use the "mobile first" approach and always look at the mobile view while developing, then after a new feature is complete, look at the desktop browser view and make sure it looks good. Some DEVs to the opposite, looking at the desktop browser view while developing, then make sure it looks good in mobile. It depends which view the majority of your users will access your app from, and depends on personal preferences. But always keep both views in mind as you design UI to avoid building something that won't work at all in one of the views.(ok)
* AI prompt: "what does "mobile first" web development mean?" MM: DM: Mobile first" web development is a design strategy that prioritizes the development of mobile versions of websites and applications before creating versions for larger screens, like desktops.

## real-time-chat vercel deployment - 1h
* import a GitHub project - created a new project 
* run the app - connected the local project to the GitHub remote
* blockers - is there another way of connecting 
  * the project already installed in this repo DM: I'm not sure what you mean by this? MM: i meant projects like string-converter, weather-app, and the rest ... in this repo that we have been using.
  * to GitHub? for example the real-time-chat that's running on this repo, and connect it to vercel or the only possibility is to start everything from scratch?
  * DM: you will have 1 vercel project for the entire repo 
  * DM: you will have 1 vercel project which can provide deployment URLs for each branch (and even each commit, I believe I read). 
  * DM: it is sometimes good to start over with a new project to be able to understand the full process. you can always start over and delete the previous project
    * DM: be sure to list the steps you took so that 6 months form now you save time by having instant answers the same questions because you will often forget important details. 
* for tomorrow - i'll finish the deployment.
