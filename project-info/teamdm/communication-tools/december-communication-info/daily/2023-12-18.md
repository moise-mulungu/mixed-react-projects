# daily - 4.5h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - .5h
* reviews - read and responded

## real-time-chat official-UX-review - 3h
* sending empty or whitespace-only messages - added a trimmed message
* change username, previous messages reflect the new username - fetched user data from firebase
* blockers: the displayName doesn't appear only the id, 
  * i fetched user.uid then created a variable that holds the logic to display user name.
  * but i could not display the user name.
* Next: i'll continue with the rest of the mentioned reviews in the report file.
