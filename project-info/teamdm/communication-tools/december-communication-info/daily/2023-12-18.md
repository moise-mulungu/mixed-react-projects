MM: DM: i worked half a day due to permanent power blackout these days.
# daily - 4.5h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - .5h
* reviews - read and responded

## real-time-chat official-UX-review - 3h
* sending empty or whitespace-only messages - added a trimmed message
* change username, previous messages reflect the new username - fetched user data from firebase
* blockers: the displayName doesn't appear only the id, 
  * i fetched user.uid then created a variable that holds the logic to display user name.
  * but i could not display the user name.
* Next: i'll continue with the rest of the mentioned reviews in the report file.

DM: todoMM: write up a plan for the work/study you can do when you have power but no internet. Important to figure out how and prepare for it. If you get a remote job they'll understand if the internet is out and you miss a meeting, but they'll want you to still work the agreed hours and deadlines. MM: DM: plans are listed in the project-info/teamdm/offline-work-and-study/work-and-study-plan.md file.
