MM: DM: the 2023 last quarter counted 12 weeks from october to December, the total hours of 40 per day times 12 weeks makes the total to be 480 hours. due to the internet interruption, power blackout, WU withdrawal, daily vacations, and other unexpected events like the December electoral process, i totalize 362/480 hours which is the equivalent of 75% of required hours.
The more productive months were October and November, but December was not productive at all.

DM: hey, it's 13 weeks/quarter (I used to work at the US Dept of Labor :) ). So, that is 520.
520 - 362 = 158
You earn time off at a rate of 3.5/wk, so 
13 * 3.5 = 45.5
and you had 40 estimated as of Oct 1 (see elsewhere in the git diff)
so you had 85.5 VS 158 ...
I didn't finish the PTO plan or discuss with you, so let's start over this year, but keep in mind that I'm only going to pay you for the hours that you work.

DM: todoMM: make an hours entry for 1-8-2024 (monday at the meeting) and Friday the 12th where you can do the totals for that week. For both Fridays in this year, add this (as per the daily-reports-template):
# weekly total [weekly total hours] hrs (Friday only) 
note: weekly total must be 40. Use PTO to make up the difference if your total hours is less than 40 by Friday. 
# PTO [weekly total PTO hours used] hrs  (Friday only) 
* previous PTO hours accrued: [previous hours accrued] hrs
* PTO hours used this week: [used this week] hrs
* PTO hours accrued this week: 3.5 hrs
* current PTO hours accrued: [previous hours accrued - hours used this week + 3.5] hrs

This year so far, your current PTO hours accrued will be a negative number so you will have to accrue those hours in future weeks (3.5/week). You can also work over 40 hours in future weeks. When I was learning the Web and also during my first 10 years working I would often work 12 hours/day and on weekends. I didn't have kids and taking care of the basics of life is less time-consuming in the US, but you get the idea. You will need to put in a lot of hours to learn fast enough, so I'd encourage you to put in as much work in addition to the 40 as you can.
