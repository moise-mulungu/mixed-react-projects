what about this week? put down 0 if it is 0
MM: i think you said: "add up your weekly hours worked for the last quarter of 2023". Is it necessary to add it as we all know that the December 31 is a vacation week!. DM: yes, but typically when you are creating weekly data, for example in a spreadsheet, you still put a row for a week that is 0. That way the data just says it is 0, and no one has to ask why it is missing or remember. The ideal is to not make people think or ask or worry that something is missing. Also, it is more clear that there are 13, not 12 weeks in a quarter.
