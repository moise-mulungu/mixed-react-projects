MM: DM: today i could not work full-day because i went to the bank for my card, as it now 2 weeks. i was told again to come back after two more weeks because they still have not got any card from Kinshasa. Then i went to register for a drive license that can allow to get cash from WU(my voter's card is not visible at all)
