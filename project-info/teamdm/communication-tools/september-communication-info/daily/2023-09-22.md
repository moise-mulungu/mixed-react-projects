# daily 7h

DM: if you didn't work the hours because of a family emergency, that's totally fine, of course, but your hours worked should reflect the hours that you did actually work.(ok)  

## meeting 1h

DM: if I require you to hang around longer than 1hr meeting, you should update this file later to reflect the actual time spent in the meeting.(ok)

## reduce exercise 2h
* i did try many approaches, but i came to realize that i should equalize the reduce function to zero then return that function
* i worked on Observable to get the real result: https://observablehq.com/d/e56ede3fc00c3f0a

## todoMMs 1h
* i created a react-error file and move howtojs to it in the : project-info/teamdm/tech/react/react-errors.md
* i enhanced the anchorLink component by adding styleColor as a props in the : src/features/component-examples/components/anchor-links.jsx, then rendered it on the browser
* declared color variables to hold colors and passed it as prop in the styleColor property
  
## string converter 3h
* i started working on the font of the app
* i added style to the checkbox and to the string input text with the detected case
* i used the chatGPT image to test it on the browser on the mdn - try it console: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/
* i uncommented the Detected Case: {inputTextCase} in the src/features/string-converter/index.js, and run the app.
* blockers: after uncommenting the Detected Case: {inputTextCase}, the app worked as expected, but i don't know if there is something else to do from your reviews. i was confused realizing what misses in the code. useState hooks is confusing enough.
DM: OK, study the changes I've made and be sure you understand how it all works.(cool) DM: put (done) immediately after the todoMM as you did previously, so that I can track and remove todoMMs.(ok)
