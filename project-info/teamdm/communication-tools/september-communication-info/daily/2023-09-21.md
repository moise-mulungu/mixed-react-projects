## string converter SPA - 3.5h
* i was mistaken by refactoring the code because i thought i should replace checkbox to buttons, it took me over 2hours figuring out the solution. then after looking at the app image i realized that i should keep the button then just add the checkbox
* i reverted the previous solution then added the checkbox solution
* the checkbox is working, except how to add the getCase function in the input src/features/string-converter/index.js

## debugger checklist - 1h
* i added the different errors in javascript 
* i added howtofixerrors 

## reduce exercise - .5h
* i did not add the console yet as i was concentrated on the SPA string converter
* i'll add it tomorrow.

## anchor links - 1h
* added content to the anchor link component in the src/features/component-examples/components/anchor-links.jsx and imported into the two component examples
* added props and rendered it.
