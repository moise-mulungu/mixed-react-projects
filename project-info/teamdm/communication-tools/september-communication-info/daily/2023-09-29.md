DM: as I've said before, RE blockers, I don't see any console.log, any questions, any list of what is wrong and how you tried to fix it. So, I can't help you. 

DM: Also, give more detail. It looks like you copied and pasted a bunch of code, but I can't see what else based on your code or based on what you wrote above. Communication is important.
