# daily - 7.5h

## Slack-huddle-meeting - 1h

## portfolio: component example:: anchor link to title case - 2h

* i changed anchor links to be title case by using string.methods() in the src/features/component-examples/component-examples-two/index.js file from mdn : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
  * i used regex replace() with chartAt(), and substr() methods

## SPA-string converter - 4h

* i learned react state hook to understand it deeply form react dev: https://react.dev/reference/react/useState
* i enhanced the PascalToCamelCase component by creating two use state hooks in the src/features/string-converter/index.js file
  * in that component i also created two functions; one to convert a camel case to pascal case and the other to convert pascal case to camel case
  * removed the form tag and replaced it with div tag
  * added a two buttons to hold the two convert functions.
* todo next: 
  * i will restructure the code to add checkbox instead of buttons 
  * i will add an array to store the converted string


## reducer challenge - 0.5h

* i simply refactor the code
* todo-next: i will work on getting the solution
