## react testing

### jest interview questions - 3h

* i added fifty interview questions from beginners, intermediate to advanced questions in the project-info/teamdm/tech/react/react-testing/jest-interview-questions folder
  
### portfolio jest testing - 2h

* i added testing in the ResumeButton components of the portfolio.
* src = https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-test-react-components-using-jest/
* i tried to google for solution i found approaches that suggest to modify `babel.config` file, i stooped there to avoid complicating the root directory.
* i used another approach from: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/testing on how to use `Jest` in a `NextJS` project.
* i installed Jest packages (`npm install --save-dev jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom`)
* created a `jest.config.js` file in the root project, then added basic codes to it.
* blockers: i am facing the same following error with both approaches: syntax error: `Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled`
  
## array reduce exercise - 2h
