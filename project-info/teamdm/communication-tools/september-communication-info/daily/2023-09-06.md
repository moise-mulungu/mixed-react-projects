- summarize the content from the source: https://www.browserstack.com/guide/top-react-testing-libraries
- Added react testing libraries list:

  1. Jest: is the most popular testing framework created and maintained by Facebook. It is used to test React components and is adopted by Uber, Airbnb and others. Jest is highly recommended by the React Community as the React Testing Framework of choice. It comes with its own test runner and assertion functions.
     installation:

  ```js
  npm install --save-dev jest
  ```

  2. Mocha: is another popular testing framework for Javascript developers. It provides browser support, asynchronous tests, test coverage reports, and the use of any assertion library. It provides developers full control over how and with which tools to test their code. It is also compatible with a wide range of testing frameworks and libraries. Mocha is an alternative to Jest due to its lack of complexity in certain areas such as mocking.
     installation:

  ```js
  npm install --global mocha
  ```

  3. Chai: is a popular BDD / TDD assertion and expectation library for node and the browser. It can be paired with any javascript testing framework. It’s often associated with testing in Mocha, and can also be used with Jest and Enzyme. Some functionalities such as expect, should and assert, helps to declare what to expect in a test. It can also be made to make assertions for functions.
     installation:

  ```js
   npm install chai
  ```

  4. Jasmine: is a fantastic open-source BDD testing framework and test runner for testing all kinds of javascript applications. It examines the user interface’s readability and responsiveness across a range of screen sizes and resolutions. It is mostly combined with Babel and Enzyme to test React applications.
     installation:

  ```js
  npm install jasmine-node
  ```

  5. Karma : is neither a testing framework nor an assertion library. It is a test runner for JavaScript that runs on Node.js. It launches an HTTP server, and generates a test runner HTML file. It allows one to execute JavaScript code across multiple real browsers and was built to simplify the feedback loop between writing code and getting information from the tests.
     installation:

  ```js
  npm install karma –save-dev
  ```
  MM: I just created folders in project-info/teamdm/tech/testing folder where i will add example for each testing libraries tomorrow because as i did not have much time today because i took longer to the bank
