MM: DM: I started working at noon due to a heavy rain that may have caused the internet disruption.
# daily - 4h

## react testing - 2h
* followed instructions from the nextjs url: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-jest/__tests__/index.test.tsx
* blockers: i was still getting the same previous error of `Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled (13:12):`
DM: I don't see any changes in the repo (on Tuesday). I also don't see any information here about what you tried. How did you spend the 2 hours?
DM: todoMM: what I would do if it were me
* google search if there are any solutions that don't involve major surgery. It may just be some configuration detail. if not, let it go.
* clone the nextjs example repo above and ensure that the jest test works on your machine. How does it look when it runs properly? Then, look for differences between the working cloned repo and your repo.

## coding challenges - 2h

* solved word-mesh challenge (great!)
  
* tried to solve the opening-closing bracket string challenge from project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/array-methods/array-method-cheatsheets/reduce-exercises.js
  * blockers: i could not get the expected result even though i followed the given instructions. DM: what instructions? console.log is your friend!
