## bank account

- I spent almost the whole day downtown to open a bank account.
  - the account would be available in two days as the process took a bit longer with the registration and other stuff(40$)
  - for the card, i'll have to pay an amount of 40$ to get it, i am planning to do it at the end of the month.
