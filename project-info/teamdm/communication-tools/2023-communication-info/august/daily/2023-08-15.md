# daily report

## create a mailtrap SMTP account

- I first logged in then open Email Send to follow the instructions
- the first step is to add a domain name before moving on to other steps of the process.

### blocker:

- I could not add my domain name, although i tried to use those from my vercel account, those domain names from vercel were not valid. i just stopped there.

## Enhance new component-example directory

- rename the newly created component examples in the pages directory.

## temp test nodemailer with gmail

- i found that google has disabled less secure apps by default: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en#zippy=%2Cif-less-secure-app-access-is-off-for-your-account
- i followed some other steps following some videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVDq4VOBMNM
- i copied the generated app password and copied it into the .env file of the next-email project,

### blocker:

- even though i got the app password, but it did not work.

## recursive millipede of words

- add indentation to the recursive call function

### blocker

- after many attempts i am still unable to add indentations to each step of the recursion
