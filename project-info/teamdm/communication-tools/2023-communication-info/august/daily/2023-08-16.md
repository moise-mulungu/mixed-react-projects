## react hooks

- breaking rules of react hooks: i read about breaking rules of react hooks on the following links: https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning
- hours spent : at least 2 hours
- (done)DM: good topic. Make a react vocab entry and list the rules. Also note that a best practice is to call all hooks at the top of the component function before other vars and logic, especially useState hooks, are often found all together at the top of the function.
  - (no, they are not linted!)check, are react hook rules linted in our ESLint setup? (you may see this in the ESLint config, or you can try to deliberately break the rules of hooks, and be sure you see a warning.)
    -(done) DM: add a react vocab entry about when it is appropriate to NOT list in the "dependency array" all the useEffect dependencies

## cloning next-email-new

- i fixed the problem cloning the repo by generating a github personal access token that i used as a password to clone a remote repository: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls

- steps that i followed:

  1.  click your profile photo
  2.  click Settings
  3.  In the left sidebar, click Developer settings
  4.  In the left sidebar, under Personal access tokens, click Tokens (classic)
  5.  Select Generate new token, then click Generate new token (classic).
  6.  In the "Note" field, give your token a descriptive name
  7.  To give your token an expiration, select Expiration, then choose a default option or click Custom to enter a date(in my case i select No-expiration)
  8.  Select the scopes you'd like to grant this token. To use your token to access repositories from the command line, select repo
  9.  Click Generate token

- blocker: I am still getting the same `login and credential error` after running the `npm run dev`
