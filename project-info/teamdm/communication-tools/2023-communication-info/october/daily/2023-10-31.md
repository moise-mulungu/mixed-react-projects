* read and responded to reviews

## quiz-app-with-timer quiz-box - 5h
* i started by reading an article that explains how to fetch data from JSON file in React JS
* i firstly used data by mapping through it in src/features/quiz-app-with-timer/index.jsx file
* i then created a question-box.jsx file and imported the data.js file and rendered it in the return statement of the QuizBox component.
* i declared the first state selectOption that will handle the options properties of the data object
* i created a  handleOptionChange() function where i passed the setter function of selectedOption
* i designed a pop with a question as title, plus the answer and the options 
* i also created two separate functions, handlePreviousQuestion and handleNextQuestion to handle the previous and next questions
* i also  added to all the radio buttons the same name attribute (name="option") to ensure that only one radio button in the group can be selected at a time, not all at once.
* in order to lift up the state, i moved all the declared states in the QuizBox component to the QuizAppWithTimer component and returned the QuizBox component by passing all these props (selectedOption, handleOptionChange, currentQuestionIndex, handleNextQuestion, handlePreviousQuestion)
* i tested the app on the browser to make sure everything was correct.
