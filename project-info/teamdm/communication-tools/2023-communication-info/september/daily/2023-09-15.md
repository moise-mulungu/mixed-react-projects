# daily - 7.5h

## Slack- Meeting - 1h

## react testing -1h
* i updated the jest-config.mjs file from the nextjs link, but the error still persisted. DM: ok, so you ruled one thing out, that is good. See 9-12 for next step if you choose to work on jest more.
  
## reduce exercise -1h
* i tried to modify the code by adding new variables project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/array-methods/array-method-cheatsheets/reduce-exercises.js
* blockers: it was only returning "true"

## css vocabs - 1h
* i changed the file to how-to-css to flow-layout
* added howtocss to each code snippet
DM: todoMM: good, now, using the example I gave for min-content, make all the howtocss more searchable by using english descriptions of what you want to do. Also, the pattern for howtos is:
howto[js|css|nextjs|etc]: keyword1: keyword2:: description of the task you will show "how to" do.(cool!)

## js vocabs - .25h
* added another vocab in the project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/vocabulary/js-vocabulary.md file

## react hooks -1h
* added a directory to differ binding in class vs hook component(i am still reading to understand the code) DM: good. With Hooks, you don't have to worry about binding or use any special syntax.(ok)

## portfolio - 2h
* i worked on adding anchor link to jump to a specific part of the page
