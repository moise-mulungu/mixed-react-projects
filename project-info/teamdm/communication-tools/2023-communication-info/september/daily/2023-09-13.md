## javascript pdf course - 4h
* i learned `javascript for impatient programmers` book up to page 247 in `Modularity` chapter 27.
  * i added vocabularies in the project-info/teamdm/tech/javascript/vocabulary/js-vocabulary.md file.(i used both the document and google search for the vocabularies).
* i read also `speaking JavaScript` book in its first chapter to the primitive values.

DM: I wouldn't expect that you have been able to read and absorb 250 pages in less than 4 hours. Also, compared to the number of pages, there are not a lot of JS examples or notes in the repo. best to slow down and make howtos that you can search later.(I skipped other pages that i found already knowing a bit)
