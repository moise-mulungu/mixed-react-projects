MM: DM: this week i'll have hard time to complete a daily 8hrs work, due to the ongoing power blackout. i am leaving home to find where to charge my computer. 

# daily - 4.5h

## meeting - 1h

## data transformation exercises - 3h
* nested object - mapped over an array of users within a nested object and creating a new array of objects with specific properties. 
* complex object - an array of objects, each representing a student with the specified properties and an array of course objects for each student.
* complex event - an object with the specified properties, including an array of participant names.
* observable link: https://observablehq.com/d/c231e1c5f9a1be02

good. the 2nd one was a bit weird, sorry

## quiz-api data-transformation - .5h
* copilot suggestion - uncomment the next line, put cursor at the end of the line, then press Enter
* copilot suggestion not clear - returned a new object with property names that match the data object in the client-side code. DM: why not clear? "returned a new object with property names that match the data object in the client-side code" is what you want. MM: the AI suggested approach used destructuring assignment, which confused me at first compared to map and object accessing methods, but i'm learning it through the provided exercises in the object-transformation-exercises.js file. DM: cool. when you feel confused, you can ask AI to explain. You can also ask "what is the name of the technique used in line 3?". You can use that term to search the repo EX: "destructuring assignment".(ok)
