## react-context-provider - 6.5h
* files-structure - created new files for users-context-provider and for fetchUsers function
* component-hierarchy - wrapped users-context-provider inside user-context-provider
* function-functionalities - renamed and updated fetchUser
* props-argument - passed the fetchUsers to children components
* insert-field - updated function in the UserProfile to insert the isActive field
* steps-process - listed them in the src/features/real-time-chat/user/users-context-provider.jsx file
* blocker: none
* status: i anticipated by querying the isActive, but it was added to the users collection and the fetchUsers function fetches multiples users now.
* next: wait for DM next step suggestion
