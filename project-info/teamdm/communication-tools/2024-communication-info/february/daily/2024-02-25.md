# weekly-hours - 33.85hrs

* previous PTO hours accrued: -41 hrs. 
* PTO hours used this week:  6.15 hrs.
  * MM: i just calculated by summing up the worked hours without taking account the Thursday sick day. i am not sure how to add it in the calculation, may be you can help to do that.
* PTO hours accrued this week: 3.5 hrs
* current PTO hours accrued: (-41 + 6.15 + 3.5) = -31.

MM: i could not work on Sunday, as i went with my wife to hospital for high blood pressure caused by fear of recent armed incursion in the avenue.
