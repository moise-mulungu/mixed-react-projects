* signup-authentication - removed username parameter from  createUserWithEmailAndPassword
* user-user.displayName-not-defined - used an object access property
* deleted-user-messages - listed the steps that i took in the src/features/real-time-chat/real-time-chat.jsx file
* blocker: i could not fix the messages of the deleted user to not display on the ChatBox
  * DM: this is new functionality. Leave it for now until you get all bugs fixed and app is stable, so that I can do a big-pic code review. Good that you documented your steps, because you can use that documentation when you start working on this again in the future.
* status: the send message and the user's profile are working.
* next: i'll write a blog post on the app about what it does.
