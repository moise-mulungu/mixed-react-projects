# daily - 7.25

## meeting - 1h

MM: you said this task to not take over two hours, but i wanted to better understand the promise in the code.
## real-time-chat js-promises 2.5h

DM: todoMM: get back to making separate commits and hours worked for separate tasks. This task should be 3 separate commits: 

* reviews - read and responded
* js-promises
  * documentation-search - added example codes and definitions
* asynchronous-operations - added comments to each asynchronous operations


## reactjs-firebase-app - 3.75h
* new-project - created a new project and setup the basic structures
* web-search - the video link of the project: https://www.youtube.cofm/watch?v=_ycD0d7skdQ
* blocker: i haven't finished making run that project yet, as it took longer to watch the video
* status: the app is in it basic phase
* next: i'll continue with it tomorrow and finalize it.

DM: todoMM: going forward I need much more info about what you did for 3.75 hours, like I mentioned in Slack. Also, if you learn something new, put some notes in the new repo next to the relevant code or config. You cant watch a video for 2 hours and not learn anything new. Make some howtofirestore notes. This is for you, and also for me: I know better how to guide you (since I dont know firestore), and maybe I'll learn something.

MM: for this task all the details are found in the newly created repo, i sent the invitation for that.
