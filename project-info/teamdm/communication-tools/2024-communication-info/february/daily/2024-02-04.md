## real-time-chat bug-fix - 2.75h
* identifying-discrepancy - compared the connectedUsers and the updatedUsers array
* debugging-process - added console.logs
* step-details - listed them in the src/features/real-time-chat/real-time-chat.jsx file
* blocker: even though the connected users array was no more empty, but it doesn't match with updatedUsers array
* status: the connected user on the page still list the same connected user multiple times
* next: i can just ask for help because i am still unable to figure out where the exact issue is.
