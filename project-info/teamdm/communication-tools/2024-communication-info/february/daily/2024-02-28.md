# daily - 5.75h

## meeting - 1h

## users-context-provider - 3.75h
* reviews - read and responded
* real-time-query - gave my approaches and modified functions
* debugging - fixed the fetchUsers().then is not function by returning the Promise
* blocker: none
* status: the application works as before
* next: wait for DM guidance after adding approaches for real-time changes from database

## real-time-chat displayName - 1h
* debugging - added console log to find out undefined displayName
* steps-process - listed them in the src/features/real-time-chat/real-time-chat.jsx file
* blocker: none
* status: the displayName is still undefined
* next: will work on it after completing the context provider 
  * DM: yes. Do it in these steps:
    * 1. done: create a new src/pages/real-time-chat/test-users.jsx which will be URL localhost:3005/real-time-chat/test-users
    * 2. done: display the users in this new page. use this page to easily see what users data you have
      * done: just use <pre>{JSON.stringify(users, null, 2)}</pre> // simplest way to view contents of a complicated JS object/data structure
    * 3. continue working to collect in fetch-users.js all the user info that the app will need
    * 4. once you have all user data in one place in the provider, use that data in the app wherever you need it
