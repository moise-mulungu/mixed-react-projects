  * unlike the other one which talks about many different topics : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hR-uWjBAgw.
    * DM: good point: it covers Firebase Image Upload which you dont need now, and Firebase Deploying and Hosting which you dont need because you'll use Vercel for consistency
      * but Firebase Authentication, Firestore CRUD, Firestore Rules look interesting
        * (done)DM: todoMM: do you know what CRUD means? MM: i know the meaning ; create, read, update, and delete, but i need to know how to use each one individually in a code as they are often considered the fundamental operations for interacting with data in a software application or system. For example in Ruby/RubyOnRails they are almost used anytime.
        * (done)DM: todoMM: BTW are you using Sider feature, highlight a word/phrase and there is a popup - click on "explain" - very useful. MM: cool, i just try it it's amazing!
      * DM: todoMM: take 30 minutes to have a look at the code at https://github.com/machadop1407/react-firebase-course/tree/main/src (Github repo is in the youtube "more ..." description) and click around the repo on github.com and see if you see anything useful or interesting.

## real-time-chat google-login - 1.5h
* firebase-config - imported functions and declared new variables
* user-authentication - created a handle-login-with-google function and passed as props to Login component
* Login-page - added a button to login with google
* process-details - listed the process in the src/features/real-time-chat/user/login.jsx file
* blocker: there was no blocker, after watching the video tutorial
* status: user can login with his google account without any problem
* next: i'll try to resume debugging the displayName not showing up issue
  * DM: finish the tutorial first; the idea is you learn more about firebase then with new knowledge, you can fix the bugs in the chat app.(ok)

DM: google login is a good feature, but stop adding new things for now so that you can focus on tutorials (the purpose of doing the tutorials is so that you can learn enough to fix existing bugs which are the higher priority)(got it)
