* blocker: watching and coding along take time as there are new things to learn
  * DM: ok, but this is not a blocker, just mention it in a bullet point :)
* status: the code works perfectly 
* next: i will work on improving the UI with tailwind instead of the normal CSS.
  * DM: no don't worry about TW for now, unless you decide to make this a portfolio app, you can do TW later, or not. The purpose of this project is to learn react/firebase techniques so that you can get back to real-time-chat and fix it up - that is the priority and nice UI for a practice repo is a low priority. Glad you are listing next steps so that I can comment on them.(ok)
