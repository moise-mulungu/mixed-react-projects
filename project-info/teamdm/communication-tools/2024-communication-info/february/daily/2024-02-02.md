MM: i started working too late at 4 pm today as the one who was fixing my laptop took all the day to do it. but i'll work at weekend for these missing two days. 
# daily - 3.25h

## meeting - 2h
MM: i updated the meeting of the last Friday 

## todoMMs - .75h
* reviews - read and responded
* PTO-hours-accrued - made calculation
* official-ux-review - updated tasks' list

## real-time-chat bug-send-messages - .5h
* diff-commit - tried to compare the latest commit to the latest no-bug commit
* blocker: i should use GitLens to compare the two commits but i couldn't signup
* status: the send message button in the message input doesn't work, but i can access the user's profile
* next: i'll work on the issue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

(done)DM: todoMM: for real-time-chat app
* don't add any new features but rather focus on fixing bugs and get the app working again. 
* Once it is working, I'd like you to write a blog post on the app and what it does. It will be good to have a blog post eventually, and for now it will be good to list what the app does, how it does it (how you used firebase) in order to recognize your accomplishments so far on this project. real-time chat is a difficult kind of app.

DM: after the app is working again, I'll look review it for some bigger-picture stuff.(ok)
