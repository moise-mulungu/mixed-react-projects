MM: DM: today, i didn't work on the solidarity-collect-fund project because of three hours power blackout in the afternoon. i could have worked more than 8hrs today because i started my day at 8 am.

# daily - 7h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - 1h
* reviews - read and responded

## real-time-chat update-user-profile - 3h
* update-username-in-real-time - set up a real-time listener for changes in the user's profile
* delay-in-updating-the-username - used await key-word to pause the execution of the handleUpdateProfile function until the promises returned by updateProfile and setDoc are resolved.
* to-let-user-know-the-update-of-their-profile - added a new state, installed loading indicators
* official-UX-reviews - update the suggested comments.

DM: good! the app is looking good, keep going!

## real-time-chat animated typing dots - 2h
* animated typing dots: 
  - inserted the typingUser into connectedUser
  - set onTyping to true when typing and false when no typing
* blocker: after the code update, the animated typing was not working. to solve that:
  - added console.logs, checked the typing node in Realtime Database of the application on Firebase
  - provided steps for debugging in the src/features/real-time-chat/message-input.jsx file
* status: the animated typing is not working yet after all the attempts
* next: i'll double check the realtime database code if it's correctly set, and will work on wrong email format.
DM: good, see my suggestions and keep working it
