DM: you committed this 45 minutes after the todoMM commit, so why are there 2 hours on it? I lowered the hours to 45 minutes. you can "pad" a little extra, like rounding up to each 15 minutes, but 1.25 extra hours is way too much.

Think about how you can use the userContext to inject "mock" fake data so that you can work on the UI when Internet is out and power is on. If the other firebase data were in a context provider, perhaps you could do the same with mock messages data.
