# weekly-hours - 37.25 hrs
6.25 + 11 + 9 + 9 + 2 = 37.25 (I changed yesterdays hours due to no meeting)

DM: todoMM: see the Jan 19, it shows an example how to make the "current PTO hours accrued" calculation and where "previous PTO hours accrued" comes from:
* previous PTO hours accrued:
* PTO hours used this week: 2.75 hrs
* PTO hours accrued this week: 3.5 hrs
* current PTO hours accrued: you can help me with calculation here 

# daily - 2h
