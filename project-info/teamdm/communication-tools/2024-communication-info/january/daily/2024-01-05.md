# weekly-total-hours - 26.5h

# daily - 7.75h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - 3h
* reviews - read and responded
* official-ux-review - separate done tasks from undone ones
* avoid repetitive code - make the code easier to read.

## configuration files - .25h
* avoid config trouble - place config files in a new repository

## real-time-chat chatbox-messages - 1h
* official-ux-review - made the chatbox automatically scrollable for messages
* the userData state is being set but not used - display user's name first or sender's id second

## real-time-chat user-login - 2.5h
* user delete their own messages - pass currentUser as props and compare if the uid is the same for the connected user and the sender
* blockers: the delete icon disappear for the current user. i'll continue with it tomorrow
* status of the code: the profile photo isn't being load and the delete message icon doesn't show for the logged in user.

(done)DM: todoMM: going forward, keep listing the status of any project you work on in the daily reports and also update the UX review file to keep in current with the work you've done.
MM: i think i provided the status of this ongoing project above(status of the code: the profile photo isn't being load and the delete message icon doesn't show for the logged in user.)! DM: note the word "keep" above - it indicates keep (continue) doing it, nothing more, no criticism implied.(ok)
MM: Is that status not clear or i should add more details to it? and about the UX review, you told me to move done stuff at its own place, so i am doing so regularly in the dm-official-ux-review.md file! DM: only this: "in the daily reports and also update the UX review file to keep in current with the work you've done"
DM: you could ask AI to explain the intention of any of my messages that raise questions in your mind, or ask: what are the intentions and action items implied in this message? - AI can properly interpret English usage that you are not familiar with yet and if you ask specifically, explain to you items like the meaning of "keep" in the sentence. This will save us time and misunderstanding and accelerate your understanding of tech/professional English. See the image.png file for an example of what AI told me.(good!)
