## real-time-chat chatbox-messages - 1h
* official-ux-review - made the chatbox automatically scrollable for messages
* the userData state is being set but not used - display user's name first or sender's id second

## real-time-chat user-login - 2.5h
* user delete their own messages - pass currentUser as props and compare if the uid is the same for the connected user and the sender
* blockers: the delete icon disappear for the current user. i'll continue with it tomorrow
* status of the code: the profile photo isn't being load and the delete message icon doesn't show for the logged in user.

DM: todoMM: going forward, keep listing the status of any project you work on in the daily reports and also update the UX review file to keep in current with the work you've done.
