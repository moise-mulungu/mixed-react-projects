DM: todoMM: this doesn't seem like it merits 2 hours. As I mentioned creating i18n.js should take only a few minutes and the info/changes in project-overview don't seem like 2 hours of work to me. I'm mentioning this and pressing you to justify the hours you put down because this same pressure was on me at my last job ... that's just the way it is on the job.

## real-time-chat update displayName - 1.5
* update functions for connected users - added a new user to the connectedUsers state and sets isAuthenticated to true.

* status: the username doesn't get update, and the user profile image doesn't upload.  DM: what is your next step?


DM: looking at the files and git diffs, today's work absolutely does not look like 9 hours of work, much less in fact. When you commit, think about how it looks, and if the diffs don't show 9 hours of work, then explain what you did for that time, ideally inline in comments in the relevant code.
