(done)DM: todoMM: this doesn't seem like it merits 2 hours. As I mentioned creating i18n.js should take only a few minutes and the info/changes in project-overview don't seem like 2 hours of work to me. I'm mentioning this and pressing you to justify the hours you put down because this same pressure was on me at my last job ... that's just the way it is on the job. MM: the task was to translate each french sentence, phrase into English and provide understanding details of the project, so i was comparing both AI and google translation tools to allow tech lead or other supervisors maybe in the future to not get confused with my terminology. I should do it with care and not to rush i think!

DM: looking at the files and git diffs, today's work absolutely does not look like 9 hours of work, much less in fact. When you commit, think about how it looks, and if the diffs don't show 9 hours of work, then explain what you did for that time, ideally inline in comments in the relevant code. MM: the project that i am building is using a technology that hasn't many documentations online(firebase), so i almost rely on AI to generate most of the code, and regarding my level as a junior developer, it's not easy to understand the full AI provided code. instead of rushing to make it work, it's better for me to learn it slow as you told me one day to not focus all the time on AI. for this year i took the initiative to not rush things, but to understand the concept even though it's beyond my understanding. You know i am not a Senior dev, but a Junior!
