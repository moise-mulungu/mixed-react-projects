## solidarity-collect-fund - 1.5h
* react-table - installed the package
  * DM: todoMM: make sure you have somewhere a discussion about choices, why react-table? if you add a new package to the project, you should explain why it is needed and why existing packages/code won't suffice. (that said, react-table is a good choice you just need to communicate why)
* react-hooks - used useMemo and useState
* table-columns-and-rows - created table columns
* blockers: the input fields are not editable, i'll continue working on it tomorrow
* status: the app is static, it's not dynamic yet.
* next: i will work on the input fields to make them editable, and add a submit button
