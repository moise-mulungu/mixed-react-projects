* fix-input-editing - pass updateMyData to cellProps
* blockers: i got the "TypeError: updateMyData is not a function" error. the solution would be  to define your columns inside the component where updateMyData is defined, so that updateMyData is in scope and can be used directly in the Cell component.
* status: the input works, but it's throwing an error
* next: i'll fix the error and work on submitting the column input data and display it on a new table.
