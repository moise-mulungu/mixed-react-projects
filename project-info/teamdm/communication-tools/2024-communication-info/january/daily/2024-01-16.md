(ok)DM: going forward, please do the todoMMs related to a project, such as the following 3 bullet points, inside the commit for that project (i.e., not here but in the "real-time-chat upload-profile-image" section)
* official-UX-review - updated a comment 
* avoid a setter function inside another - kept the function clean
* fix the username update - added an if clause to make the upload photo optional

## real-time-chat upload-profile-image - 2h
* upload-profile-photo - extracted the code that updates the user's profile and Firestore document into a separate function updateProfileAndFirestore
* official-UX-review - updated the file
* status: the suggested remaining features listed in the official-ux-review file will be added one after the other. 

DM: good work, I see the username and profile image are editable separately and both at the same time.(ok)

DM: will the profile image show in the UI in the Connected Users section? MM: i am thinking on how to add the profile image to it.
