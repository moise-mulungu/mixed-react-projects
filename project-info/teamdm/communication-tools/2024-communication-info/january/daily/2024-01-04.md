MM: DM: i went to deal with the new house rentals.

# daily - 5h

## meeting - 1h

## todoMMs - 1.5h
* reviews - read and responded
* naming convention - gave a descriptive name
* selected profile image - made it optional not mandatory

## real-time-chat profile-popup - 2.5h
* username change color - added mouseover features
* close the popup - added condition and a button 

DM: todoMM: note the status of the project in the daily reports EX status should include what is currently a bug - that way I don't lose time trying a broken feature.(good)
