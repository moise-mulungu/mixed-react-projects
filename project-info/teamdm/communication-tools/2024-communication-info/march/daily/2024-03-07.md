DM: item for your debugging checklist. "question assumptions about code dependencies and confirm through direct verificatio". You assumed that test-users-2 was using the code that you had edited earlier. look at src/pages/real-time-chat-page/test-users-2.jsx and follow the chain of imports back to see what code test-users-2 is using. If something doesnt work, we often assume it is because of something we did recently, but that may not be the case. 
DM: todoMM: keep working on users-context-provider-2 to get it working as much as possible. Then RE isActive, revisit the 2 solution options I put in slack May 6 at the end of the daily thread
