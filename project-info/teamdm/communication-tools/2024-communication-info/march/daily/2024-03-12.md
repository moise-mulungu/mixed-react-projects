## test-users-2 debug - 7.25h
* debug-process - listed them in the src/features/real-time-chat/user/index.jsx file
* debug-tools - worked on two browsers; firefox and chrome
* blocker: the users collection in the firebase console was not getting updated when a new user signs up
* status: the users collection doesn't receive new signed user yet.
* next: i'll investigate the users object that is set in the users-context-provider that wraps the first user-context-provider and would ask for DM's hint
