MM: I difficultly worked due to the internet repetitive instability interruptions all the day, but i'll make sure to find a solution for that in the coming days. i started early in the morning around 8 am, but i worked less than 10 hours as i was expecting to. i couldn't find a to better calculate my hours today. these below are just estimations

# daily - 7.5h

## meeting - 1h

## test-users-2 - 6.5h
* step-process - listed them in the src/features/real-time-chat/test-users-2.jsx file
* testing-tools - i worked on both Firefox and Chrome to check for users update
* blocker: after many attempts and code changes, the test were not being updated
* status: the test-users-2 page has still one user and doesn't update
* next: wait for DM's hints
