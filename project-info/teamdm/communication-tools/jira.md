# initial setup
* added on Confluence
* project: "main"
* selected integrations: slack, gitlab


# plan
## active sprint layout:
* columns
  * to do
  * in progress
  * code review & test ("sanity test"?)
  * ready to deploy
  * test ... ("integration test"?)
  * blocked
  * done
* 2-week sprints
* workflow   **!!!!!!!!!!! START HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!**
  * lead: create ticket, set the sprint, if will work on it immediately, or leave it in the "backlog"
  * lead: assign ticket to dev (initially in dev's "to do" column)
  * dev: to do -> in progress
    * when dev starts working on the ticket
    * dev codes, tests locally 
    * create a MR in gitlab
  * dev: in progress -> code review & test (dev assigns the ticket to lead, ping him on slack)
    * code review & test
      * code review: todoDM: detail
  * code review & test -> test
    * integration? test in browser - make sure code works with the other 

## what's missing from the work configuration
* can't see who did the work on the card that you move around in the 'kanban' area
* notification of change: email and slack
* 


## ??? hourly notes? DM will try it at work ... I think it will help me a lot, but I want to see how tedious it gets
