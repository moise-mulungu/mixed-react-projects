## leaving notes for each other in .js and .md files
* !each person always use this own initials, that way you can always find what you wrote (works better if there is more than 2 people on the team)
  * todoXX is the exception
* ??? aka "fishhooks" means there is a question, concern, "hey look at this"
  * ???DM, ???MM
    * ???DM Moise, is MM your preferred initials (of your names)
* in .js comments or .md files
  * word? - the "?" signifies doubt about the correct word (?? signifies doubt about the concept, approach)
* !!! means "important" depending on the number of "!"
* comments: DM: | MM: (on a a new line above the line the comment references)
  * in JS code: // DM: 
  * in .md (Markdown) files: DM: 
  * examples
	```js
	// DM: comments or questions Duncan writes go here
  ```
  ```markdown
  MM: comments or questions Moise writes go here
  ```
  * note: putting changes on newlines makes it easier for Git to merge (I assume)
* TODOs: 
  * MM: todoDM: MM tells DM a task to do
  * DM: todoMM: DM tells MM a task to do
* after a task is completed, add (done) or (partial - explain what's left, in this case). Examples:
  * (done) Moise's task 1
  * (partial) Moise's task 2
    * MM: I still need to do subtask 3 (DM: tell me this in context, i.e., write it where subtask 3 is in the repo files)
  * DM: hey, if I don't put todoMM but my comment is an instruction to do something, put (done) afterwards

## knowledge base (KB): this repo will serve as a 'repository' our our accumulated knowledge
* leave notes anywhere (in-context notes are best)
  * all notes start with "lesson: "
  * all programming techniques start with "howto*: "
  * examples
	```js
	// howtojs: array.reduce() don't forget to always 'return acc' or you'll get a weird error that includes the number 7
	// howtotailwind: some lesson you learned specifically about tailwindcss
	// howtocss: center a div horizontally margin: auto
	```
  * whenever you have a question, before you google, do a vscode global search (regex) (ctrl+shift+F): ```howtocss:.*center.*div```
* reusable functions and code snippets
  * src/utils/array|object|string|etc - write the function or snippet there



## GitLab (or Github)

## Jira: ./jira

## VS Code (/project-info/*.md files in the repo)
* branch "development"

## Slack https://teamdm-global.slack.com
* for the time that we're both online, after 4pm Goma (7am MT), let's use this to stay in touch for quick questions and updates
