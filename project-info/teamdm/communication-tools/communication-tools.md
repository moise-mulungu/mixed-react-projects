## leaving notes for each other in .js and .md files
* ??? aka "fishhooks" means there is a question, concern, "hey look at this"
  * ???DM, ???MM
    * ???DM Moise, is MM your preferred initials (of your names)
* in .js comments or .md files
  * word? - the "?" signifies doubt about the correct word (??? signifies doubt about the concept, approach)
* !!! means "important" depending on the number of "!"
* comments in code: 
  * Duncan's comments start with: // DM: 
  * Moise's comments start with: // MM: 
  * ex
	```js
	// DM: duncan's comment goes here
  ```
* TODOs: "todoDM: ", "todoMM: "

## knowledge base (KB): this repo will serve as a 'repository' our our accumulated knowledge
* leave notes anywhere (in-context notes are best)
  * all notes start with "lesson: "
  * all programming techniques start with "howto*: "
  * examples
	```js
	// howtojs: array.reduce() don't forget to always 'return acc' or you'll get a weird error that includes the number 7
	// howtotailwind: some lesson you learned specifically about tailwindcss
	// howtocss: center a div horizontally margin: auto
	```
  * whenever you have a question, before you google, do a vscode global search (regex) (ctrl+shift+F): ```howtocss:.*center.*div```
* reusable functions and code snippets
  * src/utils/array|object|string|etc - write the function or snippet there
