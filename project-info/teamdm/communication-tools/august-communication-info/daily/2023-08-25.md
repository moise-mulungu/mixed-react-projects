## react custom hooks - 2 hours

- created a custom react hook that consists of checking whether the user is online or offline from https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks DM: cool! https://react.dev/learn is a good place to read
- added it to the repo pages directory for testing
- added vocabularies

## react hooks - 1 hour

- updated vocabularies from todoMMs

## react testing - 1 hour

- read about adding unit test in react with jest
- i could not make the portfolio content test pass
  - DM: add some info in the test file about the status, what is wrong, what you tried so far to fix it. This is needed for me to help, and for yourself, if you return to the problem after a few weeks, it is very helpful to have some notes, so that you don't have to re-try everything.(ok)

## get the bank account - 3 hours

- i was frustrated after spending long time at the bank to get my account number, after three days they could not create my account. i should stay there for long hours to make it work. here is my account number: DM: never put secrets in the repo!(ok)
- i was told to go back next week to get the bank app and apply for a card.

MM: DM: for my 8h day work, i don't mention break time that i take for each activity. DM: correct. You should take 10min break each hour (do what you like, but it helps to get away from the computer, look something besides the screen)
