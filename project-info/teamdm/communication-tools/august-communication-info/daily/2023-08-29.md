# 1. daily - 5.5h plus 1h break

## 1.1. react custom hooks - .5

- move the save button and status bar file to the src directory and make in compile

## 1.2. react testing - 3h

- I started fixing bugs in the file:

  - the first error was: `Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled`
  - created a ``.babelrc` file in the root directory then added :

        ```js
        {
        "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
        }

    src = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63005011/support-for-the-experimental-syntax-jsx-isnt-currently-enabled

  - the second error was : can't find module @babel/preset-en and @babel/preset-react
  - i solved by running `npm install @babel/preset-env @babel/prest-react`
    src = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61888940/module-build-failed-cannot-find-module-babel-preset-env

  - the third error was: ReferenceError: React/ document is not defined
  - i solved by replacing to the `script` in the `packages.json` file `"test": "jest"` with `"test": "jest --env=jsdom"`

* I added two more tests in the

## 1.3. portfolio content section - 1h

- after installing @babel/preset-env and @babel/preset-react, i was getting the error of: `couldn't find the path to the import components` with `@`, i was obliged to change all the import with `@` to using the related path import.
- I made it compile

## 1.4. portfolio server running - 1h

- after a pause i notice an internal server error(trying to fix it)
- it's like there is a conflict between babel and nextjs
