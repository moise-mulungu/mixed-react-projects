# daily - 4h
(ok) MM: DM: i started working late in the afternoon today due to shooting conflict between a self-defense militia and government forces which wanted to protest for the withdrawal of UN troops, it led to over six dead.

## react testing - 1h

- added a jest-config.js file to test the basic code but i was still getting this error: ` Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled`
- i just stop there, and would ask for your suggestion to avoid fixing bugs that would affect the main project.

## portfolio project-card - 2h

- read how to add an image in a project by creating a `static` folder inside the `public` folder and then use its `relative path`

  - there are two ways of doing:
    _ use the nextjs Image object by importing it to the file, and you add to the `src` attribute the relative path of the image directly from the `public` folder
    _ use simply the image relative to the `img` tag in the `src` tag
    src= https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets

- added screenshots of the portfolio projects to the the `projectCardsData` object

## tailwind css - < 1h

- I am working on adding hover effects on each individual card once it's hovered
- i work on the basic, but i would improve it
