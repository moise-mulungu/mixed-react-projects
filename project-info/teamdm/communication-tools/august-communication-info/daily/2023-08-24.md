## react hooks

- reviewed react hook useState, and useEffect with both functional and class component from: https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
- duration: 3h
  DM: good you're putting down hours, but add some more detail (example from your Slack message: "revise JoR lessons on it so i wanted to understand more") so I can get a feel for how reading that URL takes 3 hours.(ok) DM: this is important because of the following reasons I've personally observed at work. 1. The boss always needs to have good sense of what you're doing because: he can know where you are fast and where you are slow (indicating you need some work on the areas you are slow). 2. boss needs to be able to know for himself, and tell his boss that yes, you are indispensable to the team. I literally lost a job once because I stopped making sure my boss was really clear about what I did and my value.(ok)
