# hours: 6 DM: start putting daily total hours at the beginning of each file

# meet with Duncan 1hr

- ttd
  - review render-vs-update
  - see if our auto-format of MD files is now the same
    ```
    # may be needed:
    "[markdown]": {
    	"editor.defaultFormatter": "yzhang.markdown-all-in-one"
    },

# daily

## bank account 2hrs (DM: going forward, let's put the hours in the heading lines where it is easier to see)

- went to get the bank account details related to my account

## todoMMs

### react testing 2hrs

- start to create a unit test for the smallest component instead of the parent component
- blockers: test still does not pass after many attempts
  

### react custom hook .5hr

- reorganize example component in the repo
- I did not add more information on each hook(i will do it tomorrow)

### other tasks .5hr

- adding mention to the reading tasks(ok, done, in progress)
  DM: could you clarify what this means?? MM: these refer to todoMMs, especially reading instructions. DM: well I started using just DM: instead of DM: todoMM: --- this is perhaps confusing, so I will go back to adding todoMM.
