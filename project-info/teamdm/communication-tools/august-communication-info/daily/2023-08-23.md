(ok)DM: these daily reports have been good. Be sure to note the amount of time you spend on each item, going forward.
(ok)DM: btw "in progress" means that you started working on it. I see a lot of "(in progress)" but there is nothing in the files that show the work is partially done. It doesn't really help to have "(in progress)" if it just means, "OK, I'll do it soon". In that case you can put nothing. I assume that you are following up on all the "DM:" that have no response yet.
