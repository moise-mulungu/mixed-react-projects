(ok)DM: these daily reports have been good. Be sure to note the amount of time you spend on each item, going forward.
(ok)DM: btw "in progress" means that you started working on it. I see a lot of "(in progress)" but there is nothing in the files that show the work is partially done. It doesn't really help to have "(in progress)" if it just means, "OK, I'll do it soon". In that case you can put nothing. I assume that you are following up on all the "DM:" that have no response yet.

DM: OK, good. just FYI, 'estimated' is something you predict before the work, better use a different word that reflects more certainty.
DM: also, RE time reported, include your whole day, including the time we spend here. The expectation is that you'll describe time spent for 8 hours a day.
