# commit-time (before you commit)

- view: "vs code "source control" changes" showing all changes since last commit
- comment lines - always add initials when adding to a comment line
  - // DM: hey, Mr. Moise, do this and that. MM: I did that and the other
  - // MM: moise's comments
- are all "DM: " comments addressed?
  - info only: (ok)
  - todo: (in progress, status), (done), (blocked)
- best practices
  - default export function name matches filename, or directory name
  - if file is in a directory, the main file or only file, file is named index.js
  - one exported function per file (I'll show you exceptions later, when the subject naturally arises)
  - UI: usability (ex: easy to see what is a button or input field)
  - clear, readable, exact variable names
  - add comments if new code is not intuitive
  - while debugging
    - leave previous code unchanged, but commented out (so you can revert back if needed)
- JS scripts always have "node relative/path/to/file.js" so that I can copy and paste in order to run the script
-
-
- remove unnecessary console.logs (use judgement)
  (ok)
