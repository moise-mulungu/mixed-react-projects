DM: good. a few comments below

1. Offline Development: i have to make sure development environment is set up for offline work. it will include having a local copy of your codebase, necessary databases, and any other dependencies.
  * (external) API endpoints can be mocked with local files, like we did with the quiz (the NextJS API endpoint returned a local JSON copy of what the external API returns)
  * DM: todoMM: make a local copy of the return values of all the external API endpoints you use: weather, quiz
  * DM: todoMM: firestore - research how to mock firestore/firebase when you're offline.

2. Documentation: i'll use this time to write or update documentation. This could be code comments, README files, or user manuals.
  * clean up unneeded comments

3. Code Refactoring: i'll be improving the code by refactoring. This could involve cleaning up code, optimizing algorithms, ...
  * DM this is best done while online so take advantage of AI assistance and to search Google

4. Learning and Research: read programming books, watch downloaded tutorials, or study offline documentation.

5. Design and Planning: Sketch out new features, plan future work, or design software architecture.

6. Code Review: review my own code.

7. Backup: i'll need to have a recent backup of the work, that can help me after creating it on my local machine.
   * DM your work is backed up because all your work is on you local machine and in the remote repository
