# Pramp most asked questions

## Tell me a bit about your professional experience in 2-3 minutes.
 I am a full-stack software developer, who graduated from Microverse, a remote software development school that uses pair programming and real-world projects to teach development.

I worked in different fields such as telecommunication, and local NGOs for a couple of years. I worked every day with diverse people in high-pressure and fast-paced environments, working towards daily, weekly, and monthly targets, so even before I started working as a developer, I was already a pro at juggling empathy, communication, and work ethic needed to succeed in the dev world. 

I am working as a part-time Student Project Reviewer at Microverse, where I review students’ professional projects such as GitHub, AngelList, LinkedIn profiles, Resumes, cover letters, and elevator pitches after spending the last several months working on a number of projects while in the program: my personal portfolio, APIs app, and using some excellent JavaScript and CSS frameworks while pair-programming with diverse developers from around the world. I continue improving my skills by resolving two to three code-wars challenges a day and building new projects using NextJS.
<!-- MM: toDM: Can I add the ongoing six month-training? If so, how to describe what we are doing? Is it a simple training, an internship, or something else.
I would like to describe our program as well in my speech.-->
## What are you looking for in your next role?
I am looking for a junior developer position in ReactJS as front-end and NodeJS as back-end in a multi-diverse environment that can help me improve my technical and soft skills. 
## What’s an example of a difficult problem you solved? Be specific about how the problem was diagnosed and your process for approaching it.
Situation: We were supposed to build a restaurant menu app with Vanilla JavaScript, my task was to create a comment page and to implement all buttons that should direct a user to the Home page, but I did not know that I had to link the Home page comments buttons with the Comments page, so that when someone clicks on any comment buttons, it should open the Comments page.
  
Action: As we were given a week to complete that project, I realized being under pressure due to the deadline, I was obliged to refactor my code and work till midnight for two more days to try to fix that.
 
Result: My delay affected my Teammates in submitting our project on time. We submitted our project on Saturday instead of Thursday as required. I learned from my mistake to always read all project requirements carefully before rushing to start working on it by doing one step after another.

## What’s an example of when you demonstrated leadership or ownership?
Situation: 
One of my teammates could not complete rendering his page properly due to some bugs in his code, and then he was feeling guilty for not fulfilling his task on time because we were running out of time. He started feeling like giving up on his duties because he could not find help from us.

Action: 
I suggested reaching out to someone more experienced who could suggest what to do and how to proceed to fix the bug.

Result: 
Fortunately, we got help from one of Microverse's students who had accepted to dedicate his time to help us first understand the origin of the bug and how to fix that with more examples. From that point of view, I learned to reach out to more experienced people whenever I feel overwhelmed or unable to perform any task and learned new skills then.

## Tell me about a challenging interaction with a team member. How do you handle disagreements with coworkers?
Situation: 
During our final capstone, I had a disagreement with one of my teammates on the tasks distributions, he was in charge of reviewing codes and I was in charge of following up on each one's commitment. We all seem to argue for the leadership control

Action: 
I tried to schedule a zoom meeting where I proposed to review our duties first, then let each one do his part according to the new task distributions.

Result: 
He was finally pointed out as a new technical leader, and I was in charge of the project flow or monitoring and evaluation of the project. That resulted in a self-assessment and led to completing the project on time. I learned when working in a remote environment with a team, make sure to listen first to each other and resolve any kind of conflicts face to face instead of using chats, or any kind of indirect messages. 
## Apart from professional knowledge, what did you learn in your last role?
I learned how to seek help when I feel discouraged and demotivated when facing a challenge. Another thing is how to break down a plan into the smallest ones to allow get control of each small chunk of the plan.
