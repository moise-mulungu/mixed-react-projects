# challenges currently being worked

## MM will add new challenge files to this directory

## DM will move each challenge to another directory when it is complete

## only 2 max challenges should be in this directory, so ensure there are only <= 1 files in this directory before starting a new challenge

- DM: I imagine there will always be a certain amount of rework for each challenge, so 2 should be a good number to allow you to keep adding new challenges, but also keep track and focus on existing unfinished challenges. We don't need to do as many challenges now, so let's keep ongoing challenges down to 2 max.(read)

## DM: todoDM: think of a way to categorize these challenges in terms of concepts learned in order that they be findable later when the concept is needed. (may be simply adding howtojs comments to them)
