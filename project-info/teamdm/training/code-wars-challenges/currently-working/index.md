# challenges currently being worked

## MM will add new challenge files to this directory

## DM will move each challenge to another directory when it is complete

## only 4 max challenges should be in this directory, so ensure there are only <= 3 files in this directory before starting a new challenge

- DM: I imagine there will always be a certain amount of rework for each challenge, so 4 should be a good number to allow you to keep adding new challenges, but also keep track and focus on existing unfinished challenges

## DM: todoDM: think of a way to categorize these challenges in terms of concepts learned in order that they be findable later when the concept is needed. (may be simply adding howtojs comments to them)
