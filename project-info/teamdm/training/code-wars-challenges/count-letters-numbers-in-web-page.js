// DM: I'm really confused about a lot of the todo-MMs you marked with (done) in this directory but which were not done. It took me a lot of time to go through the diffs from your last commit, and no changes to the actual code. I would hope you can be very careful and pay better attention to detail and clear communication, so that I can spend less time in confusion, and more time teaching and working on important things in our repo. In my role as mentor and as "boss" it is really important that you take the time to make it easy for me to figure out what to do next and how to help you. It is what I always try to do for my bosses.(I was not professional, I am sorry.)

  //(done) DM: todoMM: best to always run the code in order to test your code edits. This will help you find typos and errors. When I run you code I see:
  /*   return char.match(/[a-Az-Z0-9]/i); I see this error: but i don't run this code because it's freezing my computer
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
// DM: OK, let me know if you run into this freezing issue again. JS errors shouldn't freeze your machine. In the future, if something like freezing happens, you can write something is the "status" section if each challenge file. Always communicate what is going on. This is the biggest lesson I learned in my last job; now it's working perfectly with return char.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9]/i)

SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /[a-Az-Z0-9]/: Range out of order in character class
