     sometimes you have some requirements that aren't explicitly in the instructions, but are in the example.

     inputs: 
       parameter1: string|number|...; possible values: 
       parameter2: string|number|...; possible values:
       
     output: string|number|...; possible values:

  // 2. validate the input (convert types or transform if needed) (*offensive coding*)

  /* 3. break down the the 'variable' elements of the solution into the most granular (smallest) parts by
        assigning each part (string, boolean expression, etc.) to a well-named, descriptive variable.
        * each logical expressions must be assigned to a variable. 
				* the instructions often contain words that can be used in variable names.
	*/

  // 4. use the named parts to create a readable solution. Tip: think about what you want to change (declarative), not how to change it (imperative)

  // 5. return the solution
  //    always return a variable, or, use only variables in return statements
  //    this makes it easy to debug by logging  // console.log('i am easy to debug by logging', { var1, var2 })
  return ''

  // 6. list and describe anything that is unclear in the challenge description
  //    these would be the questions you'd be expected to ask in a interview situation
  //    practice reading the challenge description carefully
}
//7. write test(s) that cover the input variants and the expected result (!!! Do this before you start coding)
myFunction('', '') // expected result
