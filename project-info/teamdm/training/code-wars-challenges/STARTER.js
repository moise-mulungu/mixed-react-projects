  /* 7. break down the the 'variable' elements of the solution into the most granular (smallest) parts by
        assigning each part (string, boolean expression, etc.) to a well-named, descriptive variable.
        Naming variables: DM todoMM: review these
        * each logical expressions must be assigned to a variable. 
	  * the instructions often contain words that can be used in variable names.
        * function names verbs+noun (createMyThing) or adverbs: (onClick, onSubmitHandler)
        * booleans are named with (positive) adjectives: (open, seen, isString)
        * everything else with nouns or adjectives: (myThing, myCoolThing)
        * variable names should express exactly what the variable contains
        * see naming-conventions.md*/

  /* 8. use the named parts to create a readable solution. */

  /* 9. return the solution
      always return a variable, or, use only variables in return statements
      this makes it easy to debug by logging  // console.log('i am easy to debug by logging', { var1, var2 })

  return ''
}
// 10. write test(s) that cover the input variants and the expected result (!!! Do this before you start coding)
myFunction('', '') // expected result

/* 11. Make it pretty! Review the code for conciseness and readability: clear, descriptive variable names
       note: as you are working, try to write good names, so that Duncan and yourself can 
             understand easily. Don't use misleading or too-unspecific variable names.
             But, don't spend much time on it. The trick is to describe
             what it is with lots of words. Just write exactly what the variable holds.
             Later, in this step, you can refine variable names to be shorter.  */

/* 12. Final step: copy the solution below this line, remove all comments and console.log below this line  
       OK to rename variables here if it seems better while looking at the code in concise form*/
