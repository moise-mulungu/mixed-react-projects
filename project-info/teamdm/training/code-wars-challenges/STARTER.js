        assigning each part (string, boolean expression, etc.) to a well-named, descriptive variable.
        * each logical expressions must be assigned to a variable. 
	  * the instructions often contain words that can be used in variable names.
        * functions are named with verbs+noun (createMyThing) or adverbs: (onClick, onSubmitHandler)
        * booleans are named with (positive) adjectives: (open, seen, isString)

/* 11. Review the code for conciseness and readability: clear, descriptive variable names
       note: as you are working, try to write good names, so that Duncan and yourself can 
             understand easily. Don't use misleading or too-unspecific variable names.
             But, don't spend much time on it. The trick is to describe
             what it is with lots of words. Just write exactly what the variable holds.
             Later, in this step, you can refine variable names to be shorter.  */
