//(in progress) DM: todoMM: try passing the colors, the legend, and the initial color as props, so that this is more generic

  // ???DM: after passing colors, legend, and initialColor as props, where to call the colors , and legend. the initialColor is called in the useState, what about the other two? I did it for 'legend' and put comments about doing it for 'colors' below
  // DM: sounds good, this is a hint:
  // const { colors, legend, initialColor = 'red' } = props
  const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = React.useState(initialColor)

          "MM: todoMM:" note to yourself to finish later (but add a short instructions for you
          future self of what you need to do) I just passed props to colors as an array.

/* 

wherever you call <SelectColors /> it will look like this. You can fill in the values where I put "..."
<SelectColors colors={ ... } legend={ ... } initialColor={ ... } />
