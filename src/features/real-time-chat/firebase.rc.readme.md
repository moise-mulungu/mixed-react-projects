(done)DM: todoMM: document the purpose of .firebaserc; also, my question: config files are usually located in the root directory of a project, so do you have info saying firebase.json and .firebaserc should be here? MM: when trying to configure cors.json file to generate the firebase.json file, i first created the cors.json file in the main root directory project, but when running provided command such as "firebase init", i was having an error "file not found". then AI prompt suggested to place it directly in the project that is using firebase, in this case it is /myPortfolio/src/features/real-time-chat.
