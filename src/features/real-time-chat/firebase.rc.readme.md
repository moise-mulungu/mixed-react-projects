(done)DM: document the purpose of .firebaserc; also, my question: config files are usually located in the root directory of a project, so do you have info saying firebase.json and .firebaserc should be here? MM: when trying to configure cors.json file to generate the firebase.json file, i first created the cors.json file in the main root directory project, but when running provided command such as "firebase init", i was having an error "file not found". then AI prompt suggested to place it directly in the project that is using firebase, in this case it is /myPortfolio/src/features/real-time-chat. 
(done)DM: todoMM: "project" means the repo, not the directory where the firebase code resides. These config files like .gitignore, firebase.json, .firebase.rc aren't being found and used by your app here in this directory, so put them into a local temp directory for now. In a local temp directory, you can still see them, and it makes it clear that they are not having any affect.
