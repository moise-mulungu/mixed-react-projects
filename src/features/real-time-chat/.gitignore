#(in progress) DM: todoMM: pick which specifically of these are needed and add them to the .gitignore file in the root directory of the project. Only add specifically which ones are needed, not all of them. We don't use yarn, for example. This looks like a copy/paste from a .gitignore from a boilerplate project. MM: this file was automatically generated by firebase init when configuring the user's image profile upload. I'm not sure which of these are needed, but I'm leaving them all in for now. I'll remove them one by one as I figure out which ones are needed and which ones aren't. I'm not sure if there is a possibility of matching this .gitignore here to the one in the root directory.
