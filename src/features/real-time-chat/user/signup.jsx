            its confusing to user if you show both buttons at once; MM: DM: good, but the aim of the app is switch from login to signup, or to login only after user has signed up. or i can keep both login and signup buttons in the login component to allow access the signup section, but on the signup i just keep one button, is that right?     
            DM: see my comment in the login file
            (done)DM: change the commented-out login button so that it looks like a link back to the login

(done)DM: I don't understand what you are trying to fix. Your list below is good, but please state the problem in detail before listing your steps. MM: this assignment is from the official-ux-review file: bug - upon new signup, the display name is empty, so any messages the user types is not shown in the messages list. Solution: upon signup, automatically populate displayName with username from the signup form DM: ok, good, just add that to the top of your list going forward. MM: ok, it's done.
 In order to fix the signup of a newly connected user, i :
  0. bug to fix: display name empty upon new signup
  1. checked the diff commit of the Signup, User, and firebase config files
  2. checked the firebase console for the new user
  3. i tried to update the signup function in the firebase config file, but it didn't work
  4. i stopped here first as i was running out of the time, i will try to fix it later
