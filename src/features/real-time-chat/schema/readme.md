DM: todoMM: rename the directory to rdb-schema-vs-firestore-schema/ 

DM: copying original instructions from the other repo

review your Microverse notes on ruby, specifically the database schema design and the SQL queries. Then, I want you to write a schema (i.e., database tables for users, messages, etc) that would work for your real-time-chat app if it were using a ruby back end instead of firestore. Then write teh SQL queries that would be necessary to get the same data that you are getting from firestore in your real-time-chat app.
