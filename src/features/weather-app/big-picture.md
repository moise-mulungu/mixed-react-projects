DM: good job, good choice. Make your first version a simple as possible. 
This is totally your project, so I won't instruct you on content, design, etc., but I will guide you on the sequence of steps (i.e., what to do in version 1, version 2, etc.) and vocab, naming things, etc.
Version 1: 
no logos or CSS
no inputs or user interaction
hardcode the city/country
query the API using the hardcoded city/country
show the query results as JSON (do a VSCode global search on "howtoreact.*display" to see an example of how you can display the API query results (JSON) in the Web page)
