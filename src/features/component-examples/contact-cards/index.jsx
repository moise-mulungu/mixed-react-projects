              DM: todoMM: btw, never use index as a 'key' prop, despite what reactjs says: https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys (read this section). you can always use the uuid package if you have no unique value for the key, but in this case email serves as a perfect unique value, guaranteed unique in the whole world! good learning point - this "index for react key" issue is often an interview question. You'll notice that it is esLinted now that you have isLint extension.
