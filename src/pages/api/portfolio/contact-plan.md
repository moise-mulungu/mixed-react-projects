the contact.js and contact2.js have gotten long and confusing at this point
let's take a step back 

first, be sure to read this on how to handle environment variables in NextJS
https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables

Now search for EXACTLY what you are trying to do
(often is helps to search for a tutorial that is more specific, by adding "nextjs" to the Google search, so that you get a more exact solution)

I searched Google for: "send email from nextjs API" and I found this one:
https://www.kirandev.com/next-js-react-email-sending
* it looks good, follow the instructions EXACTLY and see if you can create a repo that sends an email.
* put the repo on GitHub and give me access so that I can see it
* note: this tutorial is in TypeScript, so AFTER you've gotten the repo working in TypeScript, see if you can change the filename extensions from .ts to .js and remove the TypeScript types - there are not many.
  * note: it is important to be able to READ TypeScript, as it is used in more and more examples and tutorials. TypeScript is just JavaScript with types.
