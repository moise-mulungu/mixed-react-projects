//(in progress) DM: todoMM: you names need to match up. MM: i mentioned this naming issue in the ./features/real-time-chat/index.jsx file DM: "mentioned"? I don't see any changes in that file today. I"ll to the solution I expected.
// import RealTimeChat from '@/features/real-time-chat'
import RealTimeChatProvider from '@/features/real-time-chat'

// DM: there is a name clash, so just add "Page" to this name, since it is in the pages directory and is never imported but rather used directly by nextjs. Sometimes you have to make an exception, so pick the place where the correct names are less important (which reason I stated in the previous sentence)
export default function RealTimeChatPage() {
  return <RealTimeChatProvider />
  // <RealTimeChat />
}
