## Demo

[Demo](https://pokedex-mcdevv1.vercel.app/)

I used a fuzzy search for the Pokemon name search because who can remember how to spell pokemon names? 

## Enhancements to suggest to stakeholders

### State reflected in URL
* reflect filter selections as parameters in the URL
* people may like to bookmark and share search results
* also: describe filters in the document title tag (for bookmarks)

### Usability
* "clear all filters" button

### In-context help and tutorial/tour
* tooltips to answer predictable questions and common user questions
* ex: describe the fuzzy search on the first column
* ex: anything confusing in the data itself
